The oldest son from a family who were exiled from their homes for a mistake, Braktor barely remembers Krazax proper. Unfairly punished for mistakes his cousins made, he seeks to redeem his family name and allow them to return to Krazyx. Having left home at an early age after realizing there was no meaningful future to be found as a lowlands smith making plowshares and wheelbarrows, Braktor went to Orde with a few coins in his pocket and quite frankly no plan. After a few harrowing weeks of looking for work, an middle aged human blacksmith who wasn't able to do as much of the heavy lifting and long work orders as he once could, he hired the enterprising "young" Dwarf. Braktor worked hard and well, but never felt like enough he did truly repaid the human for giing him the chance to be a real smith. While in Orde, Braktor found his faith in the fires of the forge and the message of hope instilled by the Seven. He also made "friends" with a old mage that often bought trinkets and weapons from the smith to enchant - and while the mage was terse and often complained (perhaps not genuinely) that the lessons were "being added to his tab" - he did teach Braktor some wizardry in his pursuit to become a great smith of powerful magic items.

When Braktor learned of Gailen's Gate, it was a solution to most of the problems in his life. It would gain him prestige, experience and allow him to repay the debts he owed to his boss and the mage - even if these debts were imagined or not. Not only he is a trained smith and mason, but his faith in the forge will mold a path forward to glory.

## Backstory

(Provided by Sean [himself](https://redd.it/jxi38c))

Braktor was born within the city of Firstcliff, into the noble clan of Ironbellows - primarily a clan of smiths and masons - one of the most honorable professions a Dwarf could aspire to. Perhaps only more noble was the art of the warrior, which the Ironbellows' gladly joined to protect the honor of the Dwarven hearth. However, fate was to deal an unkind hand to the clan. During the Reckoning, the Ironbellows poured nearly every bit of stone, iron and blood into the cause. However, the abduction and return of the Krazaxian king bought with it conspiracies, and the Ironbellows were subject to these baseless accusations. Without sufficient evidence to prove their innocence (and the machinations of less scrupulous clans) the Ironbellows were banished and stripped but all but the faintest traces of their nobility.

Braktor's clan relocated to the lowlands, pride wounded but spirit unbroken. No longer fit to provide craft to the highborn, the clan settled into a more common life - harvesting the fruit of land and earth. The clan was successful, making a well-fed and cared for home for themselves and even climbing back up the ladder a bit with a series of mine ownerships. However - the young Braktor could not come to terms with this simple life of happiness and prosperity and turned inward. A burning flame ignited within his heart to regain his pride.

With haste born from faith and fury, he left his home in the night and made towards Orde, finding an aging magical enchanter he could work for. He labored under the strict tutor, and learned a bit of his arcane magic to incorporate into his craft. This few years were a learning experience, but as the mage debated retirement, Braktor balked at finding new work - or even at trying to run such a store on his own. These were the works of mercenaries, not monarchs. It was then he saw the call to arms to travel and settle the Badlands. He made a plan - if he could establish himself as a noble for a successful settlement, Krazax would be obligated to allow him back into Firstcliff and access to it's records - and he would finally be able to learn what exactly happened to his family.

Ultimately, the end of his arc made him realize that the idea of nobility he had conjured in his head was just as much of a fantasy as the idea that he needed a title to be honorable. Losing his family made him realize that the only person ever telling him he wasn't okay was himself. Had events not played out the way they did with his awakening, he would have abdicated his role as leader of the clan to another - it wouldn't have made him happy to return to that life.

## Character Quirks & Side Lore

While most of his family was killed, the few that survived included his mother. She was more often the strict parent, almost always being the primary caretaker. His father was a hard worker in his own right, but usually was much more carefree and lenient with the beardlings.

When not working at his forge or in a fight, Braktor is a very cleanly person. His specific request for a well made bathing area at the Gailen's Gate guild house attests to his two bath a day habit.

Braktor can't cook for crap. About the best he can do is mushroom porridge - for other meals he mostly relies on coarse bread, sharp cheese, mushrooms, and smoked meats. Despite this, he loves actual cooked meals and is a big eater. His favorite food is haggis and root veggies, while his least favorite is leafy veggies. He suffers these in silence as befitting a Dwarf. He tends to carry a well sealed growler with him that he fills from kegs when needed. He favors hoppy brews.

Though it's been joked about a bit, Braktor actually does sing. (The jury is out on if he does it well or not) He mostly does this when he thinks he's alone, carving stone or working at the forge. Since he usually insists on working alone and has come to expect this, it's likely that Hackne has heard this without him realizing. (She did most of the heavy enchanting work on the beholder items)

On that note, he probably regards the most tense and uncomfortable moment of his life having to get Hackne's measurements for the Spiremail. He’s got those big meat hooks and had to try really hard to not make any accidental slips.

Becoming a Weaver was a very eye-opening moment for Braktor. More than anything else, it showed him that what he attached himself to was transitory - and encouraged him to actually evaluate what he was looking for. This was something gradually eased up on as he originally adopted a gravelly manner of speaking to sound "more like a Dwarf" but has pretty much entirely abandoned it by this point.

Being a generally reserved person, Braktor tends to keep his feelings close to his chest, only revealing the extent of then when aggravated or - mostly with his immediate group - out of a great respect for their safety or consideration. That being said, he doesn't feel strong physical attraction to people on appearance - a frustrating reality even he was uncertain of. As displayed, he would require a deep mental and emotional connection to begin to be interested in any level of commitment to anything more than friendship and camaraderie. (Though he’s not against the physical aspects of such things, they just aren’t the primary drive. I may have been referring to this kind of preference incorrectly in the past.) The Sharkai spouse seeking session actually made Braktor incredibly uncomfortable as he couldn’t imagine marrying a stranger. Of course, this worked out well for him in Soul of Tyre when he finally resolved some of the feelings he’d been holding onto.

Braktor considers having to send the Death and Debts crew to fight the enemy as his saddest moment - sending a group of “innocent” adventurers to a mission literally putting their souls on the line. (If Hackne had suffered violet death, however, that would have easily been the saddest.)
