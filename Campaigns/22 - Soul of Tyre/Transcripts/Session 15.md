# Soul of Tyre -- Session 15

Aired: 11/10/2020

Resuming right where the party left off last session with the Guardian of the Black appearing to grant them one last major question.

## Relevant Lore

**Guardian of the Black**:<br>
[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TMyaAlf.jpg" alt="Guarding of the Black Handout" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/TMyaAlf.jpg)

> **Arcadum**: The original guardian of that which is Nothing, before it was usurped by the Violet. For Oblivion, or Entropy, has always existed. Just as there must be Life there must be Death. These are things that Lord Death knew. And just as there is a guardian of the Lifestream there is also a guardian of the Void. Though he has been cast down by the usurping Violet.
>
> And in here, within the shadow of the Wheel, it has lived, waited, and watched.
>
> It doesn't look at you like other creatures do. It just is there. It just is what it is. It can see, sense you, and you can sense it. But everytime you look at it directly it seems to dissipate and reappear elsewhere. It's voice is dissonant and difficult to understand, but understand it you do.
>
> **Memory**: You are brave to venture this deeply, I fear... I fear that it may be for not. But you are one of the first to speak to me, to see my figure outlined. A chance that must not be wasted if the Usurper is to be stopped. I sense the presence of my counterpart amongst you, its power seeping, like a bright light. Bid that I provide what I can of you, but know this, wielders of Life that I am its opposite. I will not deceive you, but I am what I am, so keep that in mind whilst we bargain for words and meaning.

The group discusses what this means in reference to what they can ask of it.

> **Memory**: You misunderstand. Speak what you will. Ask what you will. Understand that my voice, my words, and my wisdom do not come from life's Hope, but from inevitability.<br>
**Belanovan**: Death is always part of anything, right?<br>
**Memory**: It is supposed to be, yes.<br>
**Belanovan**: You can't have Hope without Despair.<br>
**Mirage**: That's where Wisdom comes from.<br>
**Memory**: A follower of Wode, quaint.<br>

> **Surefour (Belanovan)**: You said this guy was cast aside by the Violet, right?<br>
**Arcadum**: So basically, when the Great Wheel was beginning, when the Seven Covenants were formed, from that wheel so too was light refracted from the Prism that is life. Which is the white side of what is representative of life and the black side is representative of the void. These were the states that it existed, the dichotomy of life and death. However, Death is not the guardian of the Void, but rather this creature is. Because as Inu was appointed the guardian of Life and so too must there be a counterpoint for Death. For Death is not the true counterpoint for Inu, for Death is above all. And as such to keep safe the Wheel's turning someone, something, must still control what is nothing, and to be its Warden.<br>
**Surefour (Belanovan)**: But he was basically usurped by the Violet?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yes. When the Traitor shattered the Wheel and broke the covenant of Mercy, the Violet light etched out, specifically, into this creature's domain and its power was stolen.<br>
**Surefour (Belanovan)**: With our question is it an omnipotent question, or just the knowledge he knows?<br>
**Arcadum**: When I say he is the guardian of Memory, that is because in order for something to be the lord of nothing, it must remember everything. Because in the setup that nothing can only be understood when there is knowledge that nothing is there, or else you do not think about it at all. One cannot miss what one has never had, so nothing can become anything. So therefore nothing is a shapeless, formless, being of Memory.
>
> One question you get is limitless, but it will be told from his perspective. You can ask him other questions, but understand that those questions will be bound by normal rules. Also keep in mind that if you ask something of the Violet you are in a place where it will not harm you, but that knowledge is still with you, so keep that in mind.
>
> How can there be creatures that know the name of the Enemy but not be destroyed? This is how. There are some places, you might call loopholes, that allow you to learn this knowledge, but you still have it and that danger is constantly there. For if you get any tainted Violet knowledge in your mind, even if it doesn't destroy or corrupt you, if you were to come under mind control someone could find it in your mind, and that's a corruption point.

> **Belanovan**: Do you have a name?<br>
**Memory**: This one has never required a name, but one supposes when speaking with mortals it should have one. Very well, you may call me Uni, if you wish.<br>
**Belanovan**: Would you say there's an imbalance right now between life and the void?<br>
**Uni**: Of course there is. This Violet entity does not wield Nothing without any form of balance in mind, it seeks only to destroy. To become a cancerous rot within the Wheel. To undo the good work of Lord Death and I and my counterparts constant toil and struggle. My counterpart lost his Weavers until they rekindled themselves, but my guardians yet still remain perished.<br>
**Belanovan**: Is there a way to get you guardians?<br>
**Uni**: My guardians are sealed, perhaps they could be unsealed.<br>
**Braktor**: Can you tell us how?<br>
**Uni**: Well, it is said that there were four guardians for my counterpart before the Traitor and so I was given four Guardians as well. But I did not elect to envision swordsman, but rather horseman, but long have they been sealed.<br>
**Ozzie**: Are the guardians among the living now?<br>
**Uni**: Nay, for never did they live. But they are sealed within the infinite nothing upon the Edge.<br>
**Belanovan**: Are they sealed by the Enemy, or something else?<br>
**Uni**: They were sealed by the Enemy. Many times I have envisioned releasing them. But they possess no vessels, no Riders.<br>
**Belanovan**: How does one become a rider or vessel for them?<br>
**Uni**: Much the same as your ritual to become a swordsman of your counterpart, one must travel to the Edge. One must travel to the darkest place.<br>
**Belanovan**: Is there a way to get to this Edge?<br>
**Uni**: For myself I would walk there, as if down a street. But for you it would be difficult, one would need a vessel that could sail the Astral Sea.<br>
**Guy**: I've got one of those. Well, my friends do. We were going to head to Maltos, that sounds like an infinite black hole of nothingness to me.<br>
**Uni**: You possess a vessel to sail the Astral Sea, and you travel to the Shattered Planet.<br>
**Guy**: Well we really didn't know where else to go, the Devil on our ship wasn't very helpful.<br>
**Uni**: I see. Very well, then it would seem that our paths align. The Edge-<br>
**Guy**: We were going to meet at the Red Star, but we were told our fates would meet there and it sounded quite ominous.<br>
**Uni**: For if you have a vessel that can sail the Astral Sea, and you already intend to travel to the Shattered Planet, not far from there is the Edge. Not far from there my Horsemen are sealed. Tell me, astral sailor, do you believe that your comrades will do this?<br>
**Guy**: Sure, why not. They really just jump on board with anything, if we'll succeed is another question.<br>
**Uni**: We will speak of this at another time.<br>
**Guy**: How will we speak later?<br>
**Uni**: I'm sure these lifewalkers have their questions, but you, you are a being of Death, we shall speak privately.<br>
**Guy**: So who exactly made these songblades?<br>
**Arcadum**: (That's a *good* question!)<br>
**Uni**: Songblades were constructed by craftsmen of mortal hands, in your land of Kalkatesh it is said. They were forged of Soulfire and of Starmetal. It is said that while the forge burned with Astral fire and the hands of amber fell upon the blades they were sang into shape by the Chords of that time. Four chords for four swords, and amber in the Quadrinox sealed as guardians.<br>
**Guy**: What was their original purpose? They seem more than a sword.<br>
**Uni**: They are a sword, yes. But they are a symbol as well, a conduit. A conduit to my counterparts power and strength, and guardian of the weavers, the disciples of my counterparts. It is unfortunate that my own disciples have disappeared.<br>
**Guy**: Which came first? The Enemy or the sword.<br>
**Uni**: The sword. The Enemy is old, but the Enemy has not always existed, at least as far as we know. But the Violet has, and now it matters not, for they have become one.
>
> **Belanovan**: Who used the power of the Violet before the Enemy?<br>
**Uni**: T’was the storyteller of course.<br>
**Braktor**: Goddammit.<br>
**Hackne**: Is it bad to ask who that is?<br>
**Braktor**: I wouldn’t say it’s bad, well it is, but, it’s not important anymore.

> **Party**: Do we know who created the towers?<br>
**Uni**: The Towers were created by the Seven, but not just any Seven. By the first Seven, and furtherm-<br>
**Arcadum**: The creature will turn its gaze to the Green tower.<br>
**Uni**: Well, then. That is curious. That has never happened before. In each iteration that-<br>
**Arcadum**: The creature will take a short breath.<br>
**Uni**: Hope is a terrible thing. It burns and twists at my outlines, but it is there. The Towers, the first, the mortals have done it. They have found one of the first. Quickly we must haste.<br>

Everyone is brought to the Green tower.

> **Arcadum**: The Green tower will push the Violet back, and the bottom of the tower will open, unsealed at long last. And there you will see someone walk out.
>
> Falcon Bladeweaver will walk out of the tower.
>
> He's a 6 foot tall elf, he has white hair down to his shoulders, green pupils and green cloak. You can see weapons shimmering in between the folds. He's wearing chainmail, and then he has his two longswords at his side.

> **Arcadum**: Through the course of the fall of Tyr’s Drop, when the Drow attacked, and in the last few moments the world was sealed, and that's when the Traitor's Blade was pulled forth from its sheath. So essentially you have been trapped in your oaken sarcophagus for I believe, by eras date, 8437 years.<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: God damn, I know I'm an Elf but that's a long time.<br>
**Arcadum**: You open the door of the Tower, which is when you were freed from the labyrinth and you walked back through the trees, you went back home, and it brought you here instead, which catches you a little bit off guard because this isn't Phlan.<br>
And instead you walk out onto the terrace of this Green Tower, and there stands another group of individuals. Now you possess the First Sight so what you see is all of them, and when I say all of them I mean you see all of their refracted souls at the same time.<br>
You see all of them because they all bear one of the Seven gifts, and yours was life.<br>
**Sean (Braktor)**: Do I understand what this is?<br>
**Arcadum**: When you gaze upon him with the Seventh Eye you see exactly what he is. As you bear the mark of the Traitor and use his power against him as one of the Seven, long since through the trials of the Seven, it has been lost of what they originally were. The Seven were not always Violet. The Seven were the guardians of the Prism. They were the World's Blade. And now you see one of them, the guardian of the Green, the guardian of Life, the First Ranger. Wielder of the Left and Right Hand of Silvanus, Oakenfather.<br>
**Sean (Braktor)**: Can I ask you an out of character question about the crucible, or would you prefer I DM it to you?<br>
**Arcadum**: DM.<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: Would I know what refracted souls are?<br>
**Arcadum**: You would have never experienced it before because of how the timeline works, you've been removed from it for so long, but when you gaze upon them you'll know what's happened. Essentially, through the course of that thing that happened to us that I can't say quite yet, that thing that happened to us, is why this has happened.

> **Arcadum**: Where each of your essences, as the guardians of the Prism, have been summoned to keep the world safe for as long as you can.<br>
**Falcon**: Who are you people, where am I?<br>
**Mirage**: It's good to see you again.<br>
**Belanovan**: You're in something called the Violet Vault.<br>
**Falcon**: The Violet Vault?<br>
**Belanovan**: Where the Seven left things for us to defeat the Badman.<br>
**Arcadum**: You recognize Mirage.<br>
**Mirage**: Hello<br>
**Falcon**: Hello.<br>
**Mirage**: It's good to see you again.<br>
**Falcon**: How did you get here?<br>
**Braktor**: You don't know this, but I saw... I don't think you can go home. Your time has passed and has been passed on and on and on and on to others, even I was late in the chain.<br>
**Arcadum**: You sense you've been asleep for a long time, for much has changed.<br>

> **Andy (Falcon)**: Do I know what happened to my companions?<br>
**Arcadum**: You recognize the symbols of your companions on the Towers, except the one tower who is missing.<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: So I wouldn't know that they're missing, and I wouldn't know anything about these towers other than the lapels that they represent.

> ***Falcon** will shake everyone's hands.<br>
**Falcon**: It's nice to meet you all.<br>
**Braktor**: It's a genuine honor.<br>
**Mirage**: Thank you for continuing to exist with us.<br>
**Belanovan**: So what do we do now?<br>
**Falcon**: No idea.<br>
***Uni** will approach Falcon and speak with wonder.<br>
**Uni**: How? How can you exist? I do not see you.<br>
**Falcon**: You would know more than I do.<br>
**Uni**: You are within the wheel, yet beyond it. You are one of the Colors. The shaping, binding... You wield its power as if it was nothing, nothing but breathing. Tell me, traveler, what is your name?<br>
**Falcon**: My name is Falcon Bladeweaver.<br>

> **Arcadum**: BOOM. As soon as that happens the Green will explode outwards from Falcons presence. It will shudder the area as he speaks his name.<br>
The Heroes of Kalkatesh gain 10 Order.<br>
**Party**: Do we learn that's a Power Word?<br>
**Arcadum**: That is a Power Word. It is a power word that is incredibly dangerous to call upon. Falcons name if stated, if you are able to survive it, you are able to summon his aspect to fight alongside you for a moment of time.

> **Braktor**: I have many questions, but if you're truly one of us that's going to be troublesome.<br>
**Falcon**: What do you mean?<br>
**Braktor**: Myself and many others followed proudly in your footsteps to try and stop what's happening.<br>
**Falcon**: Thank you for following in our footsteps, I'm still trying to take in what exactly is going on.<br>
**Belanovan**: Basically the universe might end, that's all that's happening.<br>
**Hackne**: Speaking of, is it going to be safe for him to leave? I mean he might be one of the few people that it would be safe to, buuuut... Could be bad?<br>
**Belanovan**: Uni might know more.<br>
**Uni**: I do not know. Your power is... I do not know of it. There are those that guard the colors, but to be the color itself, ‘tis something else completely. Tell me, are there other colors?<br>
**Falcon**: There are Seven of us altogether. Do you need their names as well?<br>
**Uni**: Sure.<br>
**Party**: Tell us every name except the Violet one.<br>
**Belanovan**: I don't know how much you know, but from what we're aware of, Violet is bad.<br>
**Hackne**: Saying their name could kill everyone.<br>
**Falcon**: There was me, Falcon Bladeweaver.<br>
**Belanovan**: Let's go by color.<br>
**Falcon**: Indigo was Koga.<br>
**Arcadum**: As he speaks the name Koga, the tower lights with Indigo fire before fading away. Falcon, you feel in your heart, a wrenching, and you see a vision of Koga trapped within crystalline, crystalline Indigo shapes. Bound alongside others that had taken his trial and failed. You see the footsteps of Torchbearers above him that fight even now for the right to meet him.<br>
**Falcon**: So Koga's fine, I'm sure we'll get to that.<br>
**Falcon**: Blue is Saphira.<br>
**Arcadum**: There is a flash of blue light, the blue flame rises and then fades. You sense Saphira's presence locked within a singular tome deep beneath the sands of Majital, within the great library of Kacael.<br>
**Belanovan**: What about the Yellow Square?<br>
**Falcon**: Tatalia.<br>

> **Arcadum**: Living World, who is currently wearing Mitonis the Blessed's Hauberk?<br>
**Braktor**: Royce Okrin, he's an Protector Aasimar paladin of Crowley.<br>

> **Arcadum**: The Yellow flame of the yellow tower will light before fading, and you feel that Tatalia is locked away within a hauberk of Mithril, being worn by a fallen Aasimar, a paladin that follows a wicked path.<br>
**Falcon**: Orange star is Scorter Firefist.<br>
**Arcadum**: The Orange flame will light up. Deep within the moaning mountain, far, far below, deep within the molten core there lies a singular prison where hate and anger fester, but ambition still holds sway. There Scorter awaits his release, so that he may join his comrades and reclaim which was once his.<br>
**Falcon**: We can just leave that one stuck there for as long as we can. You really don't want to put him and Koga in the same room together.<br>
**Hackne**: What happens?<br>
**Falcon**: Entire time together those two were trying to kill each other 99% of the time.<br>
**Belanovan**: Who's the red star?<br>
**Falcon**: Frotul, the Dwarven Cleric.<br>
**Arcadum**: When that name is spoken a red flame will appear where the tower may once have stood, and Falcon you receive a vision of an icy mountain top where a dwarven fortress yet remains trapped in a stasis of time adhered by deitic presence at its glory in a moment of battle, and there a Dwarven king wields his weapon frozen in time at mid strike. And there the Red light can be found.

> **Arcadum**: As you turn your gaze to where the Violet tower would be you see something that no one else does.<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: What do I see?<br>
**Arcadum**: Check your DMs<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: My DMs are empty?<br>
**Arcadum**: That's cause I'm still typing.<br>
**Arcadum**: You may reveal as much as that as you wish, Falcon Bladeweaver, but keep in mind what I told you.

> **Falcon**: I assume you people know what the Twilight Station is?<br>
**Belanovan**: I've heard about it.<br>

(Surefour laments about his obelisk plan to reach the Twilight Station.)

> **Braktor**: I have been there, yes.<br>
**Falcon**: Where the Violet Tower stands I can see the Twilight Station floating over in the Astral Sea, and I can sense one of my friends over there as well.<br>
**Belanovan**: Yeah I don't see that.<br>
**Hackne**: Does that mean the Violet's there?<br>
**Braktor**: That person wouldn't be some sort of Traveler would they?<br>
**Falcon**: It's the Traitor.<br>
**Hackne**: The cool news is that you can see exactly where they are, which... nice.<br>
**Braktor**: I know exactly where they are.<br>
**Falcon**: We probably should work on getting my friends freed.<br>
**Belanovan**: What were you planning on doing now?<br>
**Falcon**: I was planning on heading to camp.<br>
**Uni**: Perhaps it is best that you assist them from here. I have been studying you for some time, Seven, and I believe you wield the power of the color itself. Humor me a moment, and summon yourself within, clear your mind, and reach within.<br>

Falcon closes his eyes and starts to focus on himself.

> **Arcadum**: Andy, the gift that was given to all of us, all those many years ago, still lingers within Falcon. Its embers are slight, but its flame burns. And so, you may summon the fire within, and call forth your color.<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: Green?<br>
**Arcadum**: Oh my friend, you enter the great board as one of the players. And thus, I put you to the place where long since you have been missing. A Legend rejoins. For any stream game from this point forward that you watch, or Living World character in which you have purview, you may choose, if you so wish, to enact your color. If you do, you and I shall clash. Green to Violet. Should you succeed, your clash can succeed on behalf of that particular character and if you win that clash Entropy is reduced in the world each and every time. If you lose you are suppressed for some time, because the Violet cannot kill that which is equal to itself.<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: So I can't Violet Death?<br>
**Arcadum**: You cannot.<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: If I Violet Death, does that mean Frotul Violet Deaths?<br>
**Arcadum**: No, you cannot Violet Death for you are one of the colors.
>
> Andy there is something we need to discuss. You must be careful whenever this power is used, however, because you possess the ability of Green Death.
>
> Now Violet Death is the power of oblivion for it has been corrupted, but Green Death does not mean that you kill. But rather for you are the guardian of life, you possess First Resurrection, which means although you cannot bring a person back from Violet Death, you can however prevent it once.<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: As long as I know it's about to happen?<br>
**Arcadum**: Correct, your color can clash with Violet Death.<br>
**MissU (Hackne)**: After it's happened?<br>
**Arcadum**: No, he cannot save those that have already been lost.<br>

> **Belanovan**: So you represent life, I am a guardian of the lifestream, do you think you could help me out in any way?<br>

Belanovan will present the Songblade, and Falcon will hold it.

> **Arcadum**: As you touch the songblade, move your fingers across its edge, you can feel the strands of life. Without thinking about it you literally just pull them out of the blade, something only a Weaver should be able to do, and you look at it like a curious string before placing it back.<br>
However, you do notice something else. As you hand the blade back, Belanovans training with the blade is a bit lackluster. You may not be able to improve his sword directly, but you can certainly improve his stance.<br>
As you are one of the first Seven you have many boons and gifts you can give the hero of Kalkatesh, you are master of any and all weapons, you have the nickname Weaponrack for a reason. And as such-

(Little bit of banter as to how Falcon got his name.)

> **Arcadum**: The reason Falcon Bladeweaver is called Weaponrack is because he carried extra weapons on his person at all times, because he kept dropping them. In fact, I believe that there was one point where you had the left and right hand of Silvanus, a flaming axe, a bow with arrows, a spear, two thorwing axes, four throwing knives, that fucking javelin, the lightning javelin thing, there was the greatsword whos powers I can't fucking remember, then there was the uh.. oh god. I think you had that staff too? that monk staff? I can't remember the staff.

> **Falcon**: The reason I have the swords of Silvanus, or why they can teleport to me, is because of that.<br>
**Arcadum**: That's why he is named Bladeweaver.<br>
**Braktor**: If you're looking at the potential of his weapon, can you look at my weapon too?<br>
***Braktor** hands the staff over to Falcon.<br>

Falcon will see slight etching of the lifestream, as expected.

> **Arcadum**: Free martial training for those in the encampment. If you're in the vicinity you can train somebody. There'll be things that unlock later that will allow you to travel more. You can also travel through the Living World eventually, which that'll be fucking sick.


> **Arcadum**: You notice that Ozzie's holy symbol, his divine symbol is that of a mask, Falcon. A mask of a very precarious kind of wood, for you notice that the mask's design is etched in such a way, and it looks very familiar to you. It looks somewhat like the rotted trees outside of Phlan.<br>
**Falcon**: Where did you get this mask?<br>
**Ozzie**: I had it carved, I serve Lorn. Lord of Decay.<br>

>**Arcadum**: You remember Lorn?<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: Not really.<br>
**Arcadum**: He's the name of the peddler we met at the river, at the very beginning of the second session.<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: Doesn't ring any bells to me.<br>
**Arcadum**: It was long ago, we only talked to him for like 30 seconds.<br>
**Arcadum**: In either case, you can see the nostalgia etched into the very mask, the design that all those that follow Lorn keep.<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: So are these wooden masks made of the rotted wood of Phlan, or just their shape?<br>
**Arcadum**: Their visage. They aren't from there cause that's copyright infringement.<br>

> **Ozzie**: So is it significant?<br>
**Falcon**: It reminds me of the trees where I started my own adventures.<br>
**Ozzie**: Where's that?<br>
**Falcon**: Back in Phlan, I don't know if that place exists in this world anymore. That's where I tried to go, and it took me here.<br>
**Braktor**: If what I understand is right, what is left of Phlan is in this tower.<br>
**Ozzie**: Was it in Kalkatesh?<br>
**Falcon**: No, it was in Faerun.<br>
**Arcadum**: The strange creature will speak.<br>
**Uni**: You are from the first, no, you are from before that. The first iteration was said was forged from another world. It is said that the Great Wheel was constructed by the Grand Mechanic.<br>
**Falcon**: Do you know who the Grand Mechanic is?<br>
**Uni**: I know not his name. He was the first storyteller. He was Eternia. He was the Smith of the world.<br>
**Falcon**: I see.<br>

> **Arcadum**: You know who I'm talking about.<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: I'm picking up what you're putting down.

> **Falcon**: There is more than one storyteller, you said he was the first? I assume that there would be others, then?<br>
**Uni**: It is said he took an apprentice. That apprentice was given guardianship of the Violet.<br>
**Falcon**: So the Violet protects this person?<br>
**Uni**: Before the time of the Traitor, all the colors existed in harmony, and each of the colors had their guardians, but they were not like you. They were not made of the color, they were simply the guardians of it. This was the apprentice, guardian of the Violet.<br>


> **Braktor**: The Shattered Covenant, it should have been yours, right?<br>
**Uni**: No. The covenant was never mine. I guard the Void.<br>
**Braktor**: But it seems though you understand it.<br>
**Uni**: That is because it is from this shattering that my throne was usurped.<br>
**Braktor**: I'm wondering if all this time, because you're honest, you're the brutal truth. It was never about saving anyone, was it? Is that why it was broken?<br>
**Uni**: I cannot say.<br>
**Braktor**: I just don't want to kill any more good men.<br>
**Uni**: The goodness of a man is irrelevant to his death.<br>
**Braktor**: Thank you for answering my question.<br>
**Belanovan**: If we're talking about storytellers, is the Enemy against this story?<br>
**Arcadum**: The creature does not offer any answer.<br>
**Belanovan**: Do you know why this old friend of yours is being so angry?<br>
**Falcon**: Not quite.<br>
**Hackne**: Asking that might be a little dangerous.<br>
**Belanovan**: I just wanted to know if he understood what was going on, not to actually ask.<br>
**Hackne**: Was the question regarding storytellers dangerous, would that kill us?<br>
**Arcadum**: The creature does not answer.<br>
The creature will then speak.<br>
**Uni**: It might not with him here. Your strength is staggering, the power of your color is, how do you not know what you are?<br>
**Falcon**: I just woke up a couple days ago. I'm still trying to figure what's going on out as well.<br>
**Braktor**: We're not creatures of Memory like yourself, time grinds away at what we know.<br>

> **Belanovan**: What is the significance of the Astral Traveller and their grave?<br>
**Uni**: That is a curious one. The Astral Traveller is not as potent as this Seven, but potent still in what it represents. Whereas we all are bound where we are, she moves with absolute freedom. There is no land she cannot walk, no mind she cannot see, no heart she cannot touch.<br>
**Braktor**: Would this still be the case if she manifested into someone?<br>
**Uni**: That I do not know.<br>
**Ozzie**: Why would the Enemy fear her grave?<br>
**Uni**: All things die, but she is not yet dead. So why would it fear a grave? An interesting question. There are many forms of life, of memory, and manifestation. I know not which the Astral Traveller is, but perhaps it is a place, and what can be found there, that the Enemy fears.<br>
**Belanovan**: If the Enemy was one of these colors, would there be a way to get him back to his old world? Because maybe he doesn't like his new world?<br>
**Falcon**: That would be nice to go home again.<br>
**Braktor**: I don't think that's true. I don't think there's any appeasing it.<br>
**Uni**: I do not know, I did not even know that there were... that there was another. Perhaps. Perhaps not.<br>
**Braktor**: I suppose if you wanted, you could perhaps ask why they betrayed everyone, but the more personal the question the more we delve into dangerous categories.<br>
Why and how the Traitor did what they did.<br>
**Belanovan**: The Herald is coming from a faraway place, is he coming from the void?<br>
**Uni**: No. He comes from the Edge.<br>
**Belanovan**: Why did he go to the Edge?<br>
**Uni**: In each iteration the Seven have fought against the Enemy. They delay it.<br>
**Belanovan**: But he was always outside?<br>
**Falcon**: Does the Violet need to be summoned into this world?<br>
**Uni**: An interesting proposal, I do not know. The color has always been here, just like you. And yet you are still summoned, awoken. In either case, it comes from the Edge because it was defeated, or at least delayed. A setback. A stopgap. A temporary solution. But not a permanent one. And each time the Seven have triumphed it has been in vain, for the Wheel has not finished its revolution, it does not turn.<br>
**Guy**: Hold on, you're Memory, so you remember these things. The other gods, they don't even remember why this is happening.<br>
**Uni**: Yes.<br>
**Guy**: So here's my theory, the Enemy gets here, and messes everything up. Then Raquel sees no other way and turns everything back again and that's why her place is all scarred up. And she's the one doing this to us over, and over again.<br>
**Uni**: No. It is not Raquel. Raquel deals with the splinterings this revolution causes, she is not the engineer of its turn. She cleans up the mess that yet remains.<br>
**Guy**: She controls Time, but she's not the one turning it back?<br>
**Uni**: She does not control Time, my friend.<br>
**Falcon**: Who controls Time?<br>

> **Arcadum**: Are you sure, Andy? You can ask anything, but remember the cost we spoke of.<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: Yeah, go ahead.

> **Uni**: It is said that Time is controlled... that Time is controlled by the Smith. The Great Engineer. The Mechanic. Passed down to this world. It is more likely that its direct control, however, is that of Lord Death. Lord Death serves as the guardian of all Life, but there are limits to its power. Death can only buy time for that which breaks the rules it made for itself. Perhaps this being that has broken these rules, perhaps the only way it can be stopped is by a rule break, that is what the Seven think.<br>
**Braktor**: That's kind of my point. I've broken rules and I assume all of us have, but it never sticks. Amber said this was meant to be, what all of our delay brought us to this point. What if we're supposed to do something different? There's not a lot of me left. It's supposed to be you, but if you can't break the rules that I did, that he did, maybe you're supposed to do something different?<br>
**Hackne**: What is the tower that we are currently on?<br>
**Belanovan**: The Red one.<br>
**Hackne**: What does it mean?<br>
**Belanovan**: Wisdom, comradery, teamwork.<br>
**Hackne**: Do we have to redeem the Herald?<br>
**Braktor**: I don't know if there's any redeeming, but there might be forgiveness. At least that's what I always thought.<br>
**Uni**: Impossible. Even if such a creature could be forgiven, it will not stop what it is to do. Its redemption? In whats eyes? In what great tribunal will it be redeemed?<br>
**Braktor**: I didn't necessarily mean that we have to forgive it.<br>
**Hackne**: Maybe Falcon does, and the others.<br>
**Falcon**: If the Violet being was part of my original compatriots, and we all forgave this being, would that do it?<br>

> **Arcadum**: Do you want me to answer that, Andy?<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: Of course.

> **Uni**: Never in any iteration has a first been awake, who knows.<br>
**Braktor**: You also have to understand something that you're implying. All of your companions have to forgive, including the only one that matters. I know it's a platitude, but sometimes peace is a gift you must give yourself. That's all i'm saying.<br>
**Falcon**: For all these iterations, never has one of us woken up. Maybe that's what's different?

> **Andy (Falcon)**: I'm assuming that would be, from my knowledge, the only thing that would be different from this iteration and the last.<br>
**Arcadum**: That is correct.

> **Belanovan**: What would happen if we brought all the colors together, face to face?<br>
**Falcon**: It would be an all out war.<br>
**Hackne**: Does it need to be? Can they really not see reason?<br>
**Falcon**: I'm sure we could wrangle them all together.<br>

(And now, the unbound question.)

> **Uni**: Time grows short, do you have your question?<br>
**Hackne**: Talking about storytellers, is the Enemy against the story?<br>
**Uni**: The story binds the world. The story is the integrity of our reality. It is governed by the Colors but it itself is ephemeral, ethereal. The Enemy seeks to chain-
>
> **Arcadum**: There is a rumbling in the distance. The entirety of the Vault begins to shake. Outside of the Oblivion's Gate Amber Sky raises a wall of Yellow light, the Violet pierces through. It slams through the portal, and goes careening towards all of you, to silence the Nothing. All Hope fades from your eyes, for the Herald... no... The Enemy will not allow it.
>
> However, you are not alone. The Violet light crashes against a dome of Green, as where once stood Falcon Bladeweaver, an Elven man, now stands the Avatar of the color of Life. Shining with Green light, an opaque Jade skin, the Avatar rises as one of the first Seven, and speaks dissent.
>
> ***Falcon Bladeweaver** will take the Hands of Silvanus, and plant them into the ground.<br>
**Falcon**: I am Falcon Bladeweaver! Leader of the heroes of Phlan! The Left and Right Hand of Silvanus! Weaponmaster, bearer of Soulfire, Archon of Life, and the First Ranger, and a brother of Tyr’s Drop!
>
> **Arcadum**: With each of these truths spoken, the Green crashes against the Violet, and there the visage of a face can be seen, hearing these words.<br>
It struggles, it twists against the Avatar of Life.
>
> **Falcon**: Begone, creature!
>
> **Arcadum**: The Green shines, and the Violet is dissipated.<br>
In its resounding defeat the Uni will complete your question.
>
> **Uni**: It seeks to change a passage of the past. It seeks to correct a wrong and tainted chapter. It seeks the Twilight Station.<br>
**Falcon**: So we need to protect the Twilight Station.<br>

> **Sean (Braktor)**: Are we still in danger, and is he still Super Saiyan Green?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yeah, and he doesn't even seem to notice what's happened to him.

> **Braktor**: I understand, it makes sense.<br>
**Belanovan**: You understand what?<br>
**Braktor**: I'm sorry, when we get there it'll make sense.<br>
**Belanovan**: So what you're saying is you want to go to the Obelisk?<br>
**Falcon**: I think we have to, or someone has to.<br>
**Belanovan**: I think we know of one way to get there, or a theory of a way to get there.<br>

> **Andy (Falcon)**: Would I know how to get there?<br>
**Arcadum**: No, it's too late in the timeline for you.<br>
**Surefour (Belanovan)**: Is it still scary, or can we still ask him questions?<br>
**Arcadum**: You can ask him questions, the power of the Green is paramount.<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: What are the consequences of me asking unlimited questions? Entropy, or?

(Arcadum appears to be wary of Andy having revealed the bit about Entropy...)

>**Arcadum**: Okay, it's... Remember, you are of the Prism. So, when you throw your weight around, so does the Violet.

> **Belanovan**: How important is Tyre's labyrinth and the completion of it?<br>
**Uni**: It is paramount. A weapon there still yet waits for you, for every moment that you dawdle costs us advantage.<br>

(On the topic of spending order on the Violet Tower)

> **Arcadum**: Giving Order to the Violet Tower, does increasing the power of the Violet also increase the Enemy's strength, cause the Tower represents the Color.


> **Andy (Falcon)**: Is it possible for me to help fix the Lifestream, since I am the color Green?<br>
**Arcadum**: YEP, I was waiting for you to ask that. Yes you can! In fact, motherfucker, one of the things Falcon can do is walk through realms. Specifically since you have tree stride. As you are one of the first, you wield the Left and Right Hand of Silvanus, and the two blades, if held in front of each other are a reflection of the other, as such you may travel to anywhere where there is a mirror. That includes the Shattered Gate.<br>
**Surefour (Belanovan)**: So he can hop out of any Changeling?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yeah, if he wanted to, but he'd hurt them.<br>
**Andy (Falcon)**: How would I repair the Lifestream?<br>
**Arcadum**: You can teleport to the Shattered Gate, and by restoring the Shattered Gate that means more of the strands return, so you'd basically go there to repair the Gate.<br>
Falcon repairing the lifestream is not something that can be done in the confines of this session, that's a whole nother thing.

~20 minutes of discussion on where to finally spend the Order and 2 main options are decided upon.

Party flips a coin and goes with placing 5 Order on everything but Orange.
