# Reforming the Shroud

>**???**: Where am I?<br>
**Bela**: You're in a lab.<br>
**???**: Labyrinth?<br>
**Bela**: You were stuck in this giant crystal.<br>
**Braktor**: Take a minute to readjust, try and remember your name, how you ended up here.<br>
**???**: I am freed, but remember nothing. Your names, what are you?<br>

  

Party will introduce themselves and titles.

  

>**???**: Strange... feeling... can't move. Hands, body... whisper of itself. Why do I feel-<br>
**Bela**: Can you sense where your body or memories might be?<br>
**???**: I feel myself swirling, twisting.

Party asks about giving the shroud a body, it is not possible.

Toragad wasn't expecting to see a shroud.



>**Arcadum**: The strange creature will begin to shift, and you can see pieces of it become clearer into view, others seem to fade away.<br>

 
>**Bela**: Toragad there's this on one of these crystals, what's with that? When I looked at it I had whispering in my head.<br>
**Toragad**: Which crystal? 

Bela will show Toragad the crystal.

>**Arcadum**: As you take a closer look at the crystal in the center of the room, Toragad will close his eyes, attempting notably to not take a look at it directly, but take a look at the pieces of it.<br>
**Toragad**: Yet another prison it would seem.

  
The creature barely remains shapeless, it remains quiet unless spoken to, and seems to be analyzing its own form.

>*Ozzie will move closer with the seed, carefully approaching.<br>
**Arcadum**: The seed is definitely interacting with the things in the room, the crystal immediately becomes contorted and shifted by the presence of the seed. But the creature doesn't seem to be affected by it.

 
According to Glies notes, Shrouds need a vessel to exist, and they have a special interaction with Aasimar, and it's not a good one.

  
  

>**Ster**: What does Alexander know about slowly being carbonized as a shroud?<br>
**Arcadum**: You mean possession?<br>
**Ster**: What extra information would he know because of that?<br>
**Arcadum**: A shroud inhabiting a mortal coil is unnatural, at least for the mortal. Although they can achieve symbiosis it is something very difficult to maintain, and it will destroy the host.<br>
**Ster**: What do you mean by symbiosis?<br>
**Arcadum**: Like Discord. Or more specifically in this case meaning the host and shroud can live simultaneously.<br>
**Ster**: Would Alexander know any reason why him being an Aasimar to be made easier for this?<br>
**Arcadum**: No.

>**Ster**: Was Discord someone's body that had carbonized over a long period of time, but it was a shroud possessing somebody'd body.<br>
**Arcadum**: Both of those things. It was an experiment of the mad alchemist, they needed a vessel to try and control it. At least that's what Vorb thought.


>**Arcadum**: Toragad will open the eye crystal, weaving soul energy, and the crystal shatters. The shadowy presence inside ekes out and forms into an orb, then fires itself directly into the shroud to the south.<br>
>
>**???**: I can see... I can see.<br>
**Bela**: You can see me now?<br>
**???**: Fragmented, still not whole.

  

>**Arcadum**: Each of these crystals seem to shimmer with a similar light to the one in the center. With realization dawning on you, it seems that these crystals in this room may just be the different pieces of the same soul, or whatever this creature is.

  

**25 Arcana** from Hackne:

>**Arcadum**: Each of these individual crystals seem to hold different shards of the personality/memory/essence of the creature to the south. The center crystal represented its sight, or to see the truth of things. Other crystals are traditional emotions, relationships, enemies. A roadmap before you.  
>
>So essentially, you get to choose an emotion, and you get to choose a memory. The memory can be something that's, that's more subjective, like training to be a mage, or something like that.  
>
>Each time you release an essence something different will happen. You basically keep going until you're done.


* Choice 1: Loyalty, and the memory of friends.
* Choice 2: Courage, and the memory of caution.
* Choice 3: Loss, and the memory of responsibility.

  
>**Arcadum**: It seems the creature fully manifests.<br>
**???**: The pariah has faded. I have returned. Impossible, probable, required.

The creature will stand.

>**Braktor**: do you remember your name?<br>
**???**: This one is known as the Precept.<br>
**Precept**: pleasantries, pointless. Is the sky clear?<br>
**Party**: No.<br>
**Precept**: Has the line faltered? Where do we stand?<br>
**Braktor**: It's coming, we have a lot of advantages, but we have a big battle coming up, very very soon.


>**Bela**: What do you know about the colors, man?<br>
**Precept**: The prism, the prism must be kept safe. The colors awakened. They yet still sleep. We could not awaken them.<br>
**Braktor**: Not all of them.<br>
**Precept**: Truly, you have done this? You seek to awaken them all?<br>
**Party**: The bad one, maybe not. That's gonna come on its own time, eventually they will all be here. We also look to repair the broken covenant.<br>
**Precept**: Time shattered, way broken.

  

The creature will cry out again, holding its hand to its head.

  

>**Braktor**: What was your purpose then?<br>
**Precept**: To see. I was... My purpose was to capture strong souls, and to store them in the in-between of the waking realm and the dreaming realm. There they were kept.<br>
**Bela**: Who were you doing that for?<br>
**Precept**: We hoped to... We had hoped to recreate them.<br>
**Bela**: So you put them in some sort of stasis chamber?<br>
**Precept**: In a way, a kind of Purgatory. A prison.<br>
**Braktor**: No. No, I know what he means.

  

>**Arcadum**: As you approach Braktor, your vision blurs. All becomes dark. And as all things become dark, there is silence. And then, it was the smell that woke you first.
>
>You feel that you are suspended from the roof of some moving object, the coarse feeling of wood, and the smell of the material surrounds you, fills your nostrils. Slowly, your other senses come too, the pinch and bite of cold iron, upon wrist and ankle, and throat and chest.
>
>Wherever you are, you're hanging from something. And below you, a pair of eyes move in the darkness. And there you see it, this humanoid figure's face, and its canine features. The Precept is one of the wolves.  
  

>**Braktor**: Do you know why I talk so much?<br>
**Party**: No.<br>
**Braktor**: I'm afraid of the silence. Kind of like the, where you know, where we just were. This creature was one of the wardens. Keeping hope alive.

>**Bela**: So what do we do with him then?<br>
**Braktor**: That's a good question. It still exists, you know. But I don't know how you ended up here from there. But your plans worked, to a degree. I don't know what there is to do for you now, but the sky still burns, and the end comes again. I fear this is our last chance to stop it. If you had any thought of what might come after I doubt you thought it was this. From what I understand of you, you were meant to fight against this in your own way.

  

>**Party**: Can you even leave this place?<br>
**Precept**: Things have changed, before this the purgatory project was abandoned. We sought other methods. There are still yet things that threaten what is. The knowledge stored within Purgatory.<br>
**Braktor**: Do you need to go there?<br>
**Precept**: I will, but there is yet still warning that must be given. Caution, just a bit more.<br>
**Braktor**: Tell me.<br>
**Precept**: Within your eyes shine one of them. It seems that you escaped as well. How?<br>
**Braktor**: The plan was found out. The way you made for an escape was compromised, and it fell apart. And, well, like calls to like, I suppose. And we all met at the Station.<br>
**Braktor**: In the very end to secure our victory, it more than gave up everything. I don't know if they still exist, maybe they do, with the passing of things, but. Yes. The plan to gather everyone went wrong and was found out. 
>
>We were betrayed, but from that betrayal came resolve, and we bought the world some time. And now we are but flickering embers of candles, passing out hopes and knowledges on to others so that, maybe, this will be the final go around.
**Precept**: Very well, we are running out of time. Purgatory awaits, its secrets are yours to claim. We, I, have confessions to make.<br>
**Braktor**: Don't we all. Please, tell me.<br>

  
  

# Purgatory

CRITICAL LORE ALERT.



  
  

>**Precept**: We were not ready when the Violet came. It washed away all that was built. Our world, our people. All of Kalkatesh. It was devastating, so many souls stolen from the lifestream, faded into nothing but ash. It was from that that the order was formed. An order that would watch this creature's movements, for was it not for the heroes of our day it would have destroyed us all.
>
>When I, we, tried everything to face it. But when it returned, we looked to the heroes once more, and they paid the price in their blood, and again the turning of the great wheel was paused. I... I will simply show you.

>**Arcadum**: Okay. You see that in the midst of the abyssal ocean several mages are rising up stone and earth. Then once an island is made so, the stacking of mortar and brick, as a tower, an inner keep, is built.
And then, you see it. Purgatory. As fresh as the day that you first walked that journey all those years ago.
>
>And with that, there is more that is revealed. Purgatory, you will see flashes of insight, intention, and what actually happened. I will get to reveal to you, Sean, something that nobody knows, including yourself. Purgatory was developed within those of the first iterations, technically first and second, in order to combat the Enemy. But it was not until the 5th iteration that the gamble was chosen. Purgatory was designed to put souls, captured within the lifestream, through horrifying rigors. Despair, with the hopes that they would refract and shine with the same power that was used to face the Enemy.
>
>And that is what Purgatory and its wardens did, every year, in secret, hidden from the world's eye. Wizards snap their figures, teleport those the places they need to go, the pieces on the board always shifting and moving. As you continue to see the flashes of insight come and go, and twist your perspective of each of these things, you see the great black orb which drains them of their life force, and when it falls, it shatters and releases its strength into those that yet still remain. The bracers, the collars, infused with energy that would destroy should violence is attempted. With each swing of the pick, the body is reinforced.
>
>And as such, you then see a flash of insight as well. Through the eyes of one of the many guards, you see the doom of purgatory, as you saw it all those years ago. It fell into the waters, and the great sea serpent rose, and laid siege to the isle. And that is what the visions show you.
>
>And now you see what Tyre has been trying to recreate. For he too believes, at least in some way, that those wardens of Purgatory were perhaps close to a solution.

  

>**Braktor**: You remember that it failed then, but do you even know why?<br>
**Precept**: What do you mean failed?<br>
**Braktor**: I don't mean the plan, the plan succeeded in a sense. I mean the physical location. If it was developed over all that time, everyone must have been in on it, anyone that knew about the prism. What do you think went so wrong?<br>
**Precept**: I cannot say. Perhaps it is best to see it for yourself. I sense that Purgatory yet still stands. I sense that it is still performing its duties.<br>
**Braktor**: The world, does it still... all of them? (gestures to group)<br>
**Precept**: They are torchbearers. They are the world's last desperate attempt to make natural what was unnatural.<br>
**Braktor**: I thought they were from there as well, ultimately, but. Can you explain what that actually means, cause I think I understand, but I think they deserve to know as well.

  

>**Precept**: What would you have me say to them?<br>
**Braktor**: I don't know, I guess. Purgatory is still doing its work, it must be manned, there must be something there.<br>
**Precept**: No, the ancient process, it does not cease.<br>
**Braktor**: It's sucking souls without releasing them back to anyone?<br>
**Precept**: I cannot say. But something must be done.<br>
**Braktor**: We can find the way, I'm sure. The, well, he's sending a great, grave danger into the world very very soon. That is the first hurdle that must be conquered. If there's anything you think we can do to help.<br>
**Precept**: There is. Below us there is a hall. A hall of remembrance and-

  

The creature is in great pain.

  

>**Precept**: Pieces of me are still missing.

  

>**Braktor**: I think he might know me better than I know myself.

>**Braktor**: Is the rest of you on this floor, or elsewhere?<br>
**Precept**: I can recover more of who I am to release more soul energy to where it is needed.<br>
**Braktor**: I understand, I am one of the stream, and so is he.

  

>**Braktor**: You should pull yourself together, and we'll try to do what we can to help those that are fighting on the outside.<br>
**Precept**: You must seek the hall below, there you will find the answer to the questions you have. Please, you must hurry.<br>
**Braktor**: Thank you.

  
  

>**Alexander**: Hey, you, why does your kind like mingling with Aasimars so much, what is it about my body? What makes me special?<br>
**Arcadum**: The creature will stumble backwards, its power resonating within it. It has many things that it wishes to say, but it is bound.<br>
**Alexander**: That is fine, for now I know that my body is so powerful it cannot even be spoken about.

  
  
  
# Floor 2
Soul goes to floor 2.

  
  

>**Arcadum**: You are not in the in-between, you are not in the realm without realms. You are in something that is a synthetic attempt at Purgatory.
>
>Swirling, spiraling energy pulses by you in a constant flux. Modern terms: pretend you're in a piece of wire with electricity going through it.

  

**33 Arcana**:
As you study the hallway, this is what you determine. This is, or at least it appears to be, the labyrinthian attempt at the recreation of Purgatory. This hallway is filled with powerful souls that specifically were attempted to be plucked from the lifestream for their combat efficacy, and have been put through trial and tribulation in order to see if they would refract. You sense that this area is hostile, that you will be treated as an enemy here. Most likely the souls believing you are just another test.

>**Hackne**: If we defeat the souls, will it destroy the souls?<br>
**Arcadum**: They will dissipate back to the lifestream. But I have one more thing to tell you: The entirety of this hallway is the encounter. Once this begins it is what is known as a gauntlet, meaning that we will be in combat initiative the entire time.<br>
**Bela**: So no rest?<br>
**Arcadum**: that is correct.<br>
**Bela**: Can we leave?<br>
**Arcadum**: You have not started yet.

  

>**Ster**: Does magic casting work like normal down here? Does this corridor of supermagic have any effect on magic?<br>
**Arcadum**: During the gauntlet there will be special tests added, that if you complete them some of your party's resources are restored.

  
  
  

Azolon will spend Order to send you supplies. Three order is spent

  

>Three Order gives you the following:<br>
**Consumables**: You get 15 scrolls and/or potions up to third level.<br>
**Armaments**: Magic set of armor, and a magic weapon.<br>
**Specialty**: Two specialty items, what that means is you can use a higher level elixir, such as storm giant strength, or a potion of heal. That includes revivify.<br>
**Magic** items: I will roll on the magic item table, the order item table, or I can give you all inspiration.

  

>**Epoch's Eye** - +2 shield, attunement, grants advantage on perception checks. You can sense invisible enemies that are within 10ft, but not those that are beating your perception check with their stealth. Whenever you use the dodge action you may grant its benefit to an ally within 15ft as well as yourself.

  
  
  

>**Arcadum**: The objective, in order to defeat this gauntlet, you must simply make it to the other end. Meaning that if you make it to the other end and touch the end, the gauntlet is defeated. However, the gauntlet is filled with all sorts of environmental challenges, risks, teleportation does not function within this hall. And it is going to be, even though you haven't seen them yet, enemies will be swirling through this place. One more thing, all of you have to be touching the end, not just one of you.

  
  

And that is the end of the session. The gauntlet starts at the start of next session.
