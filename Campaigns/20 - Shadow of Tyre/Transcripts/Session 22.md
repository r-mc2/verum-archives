# Shadow of Tyre -- Session 22

Aired: 12/19/2020

## Xetor arrives at camp

>**Xetor**: We had to show our new friends here.<br>
**Arcadum**: Xetor will point to figures all along the ship.<br>
**Arcadum**: Behind Xetor's giant frame several other Vega will appear on the ship.

>**Oliver**: Vega came to offer their services to the encampment, and we found a couple things along the way.<br>
**Ili'ith**: It was eventful. There is something that we have discovered in Ghels’Tahar.


>**Xetor**: It has been some time, you must tell me of your many adventures.<br>
**Moe**: It's gonna take a while.<br>
*Ahst points out Toot and Raost.<br>
**Xetor**: I can see them.<br>
**Xetor**: What is this though.<br>
*He looks to Falcon.<br>
**Xetor**: I cannot see him.

Roast will look at Xetor with his soul sight.
>*Raost looks at Xetor's soul. Xetor's soul looks back at Raost.<br>
**Xetor**: It seems you've gained new power. Or perhaps a terrible Omen.

Xetor continues to look at Falcon.
>**Xetor**: I cannot see this one, how strange.<br>
**Ahst**: He's one of the first, so maybe that's why. Why can't he see you?<br>
**Falcon**: I don't know why.<br>
**Xetor**: A mystery, an important one indeed.<br>
**Xetor**: I have seen things through the amber veil, terrible things. And yet, hope. Come, the sooner we get into it the sooner we can eat.


>*Xetor will gather everyone around.<br>
**Xetor**: The time that we've been gone the Vega have recovered. They begin to rebuild their culture, restore the ancient facilities, and with it, we discovered something beneath the city. There was a door, a door sealed from our sight. But then it opened, it was so inexplicable. A flash of green, and a flash of blue... or perhaps, hmm. I'm not sure what the word is for it, but after it flashed the door opened. We went inside and there we found the tools, the tools of the Vega.<br>
>
>Tools for crafting, jeweling. Smithing. It was there that slowly, but surely, the Vegan people are reteaching themselves their old crafts.


>**Ahst**: I think I've got something to show you if you could round them up for me. The Vegans.

Xetor will round them up, and head to the Seer's bowl.

>**Xetor**: This is much like the Oracle's seer's bowl.<br>
**Ahst**: Yes, the true value is the reflective surface.<br>
*Ahst will open a doorway to the mirror realm. Ahst will lead Ili'ith into the Mirror Realm.<br>
>
>**Arcadum**: As you dived into the pool it's almost like by the action of diving into the pool, you almost dived back up and out of the pool. While you may open a pool to the mirror realm, you do not have the power to bring anyone else there. You can go, but you don't have the power to open a portal for others.

## The Wheel of Time, and the origin of the Vega
>**Arcadum**: Xetor will take a look, the Vega begin to gather around, and Falcon, you recognize some of them.<br>
**Arcadum**: You recognize them, for they are the citizen's of Tyr's Drop.<br>
**Falcon**: Who are you people, you seem familiar?<br>
**Arcadum**: Some respond by saying their names, “I’m Retorias, I’m Nethus”, confused by your strange interest in them. Then bit by bit, you begin to notice the subtle differences, and then you remember. During Tyr's Drop’s creation there were several times people would go missing, vanishes that were inexplicable, and many times your comrades would try to find the source of these. Suspecting attacks from enemy's things of that nature.
>
>But now you know where they went. Or rather, where they were taken.<br>
>
>**Falcon**: The Twilight Station?<br>
**Arcadum**: Close. But not quite yet complete.

>**Ahst**: These are the Vega people, they are the first race of humans, I think they were summoned by the Cyclops.<br>
**Xetor**: Indeed, we pulled them from the future, so that they might have a past.<br>
**Xetor**: Time is a circle my friends, and therefore.<br>
>
>Xetor will begin to explain where the different places that each of these people were, and that by taking some from a future in which they were doomed into a past in which they were not, they could, in fact, live. And therefore, free humans were created.<br>
>
>The more and more Xetor speaks the more and more you begin to see something, Falcon, something the others do not. In the seers bowl you see the truth. Xetor is correct in all but one thing. He did not pull them from the circle, he pulled them from the root. For within the great tree, you and your comrades are from an entire other existence, one that progeniratored this one.

Xetor and his people, when reached through time in an attempt to save humanity, they instead borrowed another.

**Party**: It isn't necessarily a future, just a different iteration, a parallel.

>**Arcadum**: Now we enter how you came in, Falcon.<br>
>
>Unbeknownst to the Cyclops, they had torn a hole in another world. And as such you see it, flashed within the Seer’s bowl, Tyr's Drop is here. Your home is here.<br>
>
>**Falcon**: So they pulled all of Tyr's Drop into this world?<br>
**Arcadum**: Not all at once, but once a thread was plucked, it began to unravel. Until slowly, surely, the whole of the city followed in its wake.<br>
**Falcon**: And it's currently resting at the bottom of an ocean? The Sickened Sea.<br>
**Arcadum**: It is currently where the Traitor's Blade yet resides.<br>

Ahst will again ask for Xetor's assistance with the portal to the mirror realm.
>**Ahst**: Xetor can you help me get this open?<br>
**Xetor**: Yes, of course.<br>
*He'll move his hands over, and he will see what Falcon sees.<br>
**Xetor**: What is this? No, there is something else here.


>**Arcadum**: The Cyclops, the one eyed giants. In Verum they can see time, like as a circle. So, in order to save humanity from its terrible fate as living as enslaved dragon servants, the Cyclops reached through time, specifically taking those from a terrible fate in the future, to give them a chance in the past. Inadvertently creating a new branch called the Vega. What they did not realize what they had done is that they had not taken the humans from the future of Kalkatesh, but from the world you hail from, which is copyright.<br>
>
>**Arcadum**: In the meta context, that is the explanation of the end of our campaign, since it didn't actually finish. That's that juttering of memory loss when the city fully shifted.

>**Xetor**: What? That means... You're not a part of the circle.<br>
**Falcon**: Nope.<br>
**Xetor**: Then it is true. We have found the secret.

Xetor will look down towards Ili'ith, and she will nod. She will move towards Falcon. She will drop to a knee and hold out something towards him, wrapped in a velvet cloth. She will bow her head.

Falcon will take the item, and unveil what it is, and give her a bow back.

>**Arcadum**: Just as the Enemy may call upon the shards of oblivion, so too may you, the original Seven, call upon the shards of the Prism. What you hold in your hands is the refracted light of the prism, it currently shimmers with Green and Indigo.<br>
>
>*Falcon will take a closer look at it.<br>
>
>As you take a closer look at the prismatic shard you see what can only be described as memories. Memories of the people of Tyr's Drop, a few of them it would seem, your comrades, or those that they knew, those that they served with.<br>
>
>**Ahst**: Is there an energy source coming from that shard? Does it feel similar to the mirror realm?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yep.<br>
>
>**Ahst**: What is that?<br>
**Falcon**: It's a shard of the prism. We might be able to open that to where we're trying to go.

Falcon will walk over to the pool with the shard in hand. He will raise the shard up and see what happens. Channeling whatever of his Green he has left into the shard.

>**Arcadum**: As you hold the prism over the swirling waters of the Seer’s Bowl, and concentrate. The prism refracts, and drips down, like liquid crystal. The water falls away, revealing a room, shimmering in prismatic light.<br>
>
>Alright Andy. You have unlocked a campaign. Specifically, this campaign is meant for the original Seven. For what you have opened is a portal to Tyr's Drop. And should time permit, you, Todd, and Alex, can once more play together again.<br>
>
>**Andy**: We gotta bust everyone out first I imagine?<br>
**Arcadum**: So, as this doorway opens and it is revealed that you may yet walk the old paths once more. You may once again face this perilous past, and walk the edge of time, and venture into Tyr's Drop once more.<br>
>
>**Andy**: Is this gonna be old Tyr's Drop or under the sea Tyr's Drop?<br>
**Arcadum**: Under the sea.
>
>**Arcadum**: Here's how this is gonna work. So, specifically, as the Prism awakens you will have to awaken one of Alex's characters. Which the Prism will give you the power to do that.<br>
**Falcon**: I can choose one right now?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yes. You should talk to Alex first, but yes. So therefore the choices, you obviously are playing Falcon, Todd is playing Koga, Alex gets to choose one of his characters. Then you, the three of you, may pick one character to go with you. From anywhere you may choose one.<br>
>
>**Arcadum**: Whenever you are ready, we may play the campaign the Traitor's Trial.<br>
**Arcadum**: So, the Prism shard has revealed to you the path towards Tyr's Drop, and has given you the power to release one other color.


>**Wokou**: Moe, these Vega, they would not happen to be the same ones you were looking to research in Eassemere?<br>
**Moe**: Yes.<br>
**Wokou**: We have much information here in Eassemere.<br>
**Party**: We're not in Eassemere.

>**Ahst**: This isn't what I was trying to open up Xetor.<br>
**Arcadum**: Xetor is stunned, this isn't what he was expecting.


>**Arcadum**: Specifically it's a portal to right outside the thieves guild, the northern one. Where<br>
><br>
>**Arcadum**: One more thing. We need to sit down, the four of you. You, Todd, and Alex, need to be level scaled in 5e. We're gonna have to make them from scratch.

>**Xetor**: What I have seen, it goes against all that I know. Nothing is outside the circle. Well, nothing good.<br>
**Toot**: Look Xetor, I thought I'd never be able to talk, anything is possible.<br>
**Ahst**: Look, I found your homeland. I will figure out how to open the door, it's just not working right now.<br>
**Ili**: It is no worry, we have come to help you. My people and I have rediscovered our old knowledge, and now we will use it to make weapons and armor for you. To forge you enchantments worthy of the heroes that you are. We will get to work immediately.

>**Arcadum**: And thus the encampment has unlocked Vegan smithing.

Alex has chosen to unlock Scorter Firefist, the power of the Orange.

>**Arcadum**: Alright. Okay so, with that the prison that once held the ambitious one shatters. The prison unravels its power and strength, and a third color fills the vestige. Now there is Green, there is Indigo, and now, there is Orange. A man rises within the silhouette, a man estewn in armor, a vicious helmet, a flaming fist, and a sword of cruel black metal in the other hand. With a single step walks through shattered glass, that was once reality, where he dips and falters and falls and makes his way towards his comrades, towards his rivals.<br>
>
>**Arcadum**: As the Orange returns there is a surge of might through all those that follow the Prism. The light of all is increased, as a third color joins. You feel your powers of intervention have been refreshed, Falcon. And somewhere, far away, in the Indigo Scar, Koga stands. The wound inflicted on him by the Dilating One heals, he grasps the hand of the Neverend and raises her to her feet. He will then walk through shadows, and appear at the encampment.


One of the shadows manifests as Koga walks up next to Falcon.

>**Koga**: Hey.<br>
**Falcon**: Your best friend is awake, and we found a portal to Tyr's Drop.<br>
**Koga**: And we had to wake him up?<br>
**Falcon**: Yeah.<br>
**Koga**: We couldn't have woken up the red guy, even the blue one?<br>
**Falcon**: Was a little out of my control on which one.<br>
**Koga**: We can put him back later maybe, right?<br>
**Falcon**: I hope so.

>**Ahst**: Xetor can you see that guy?<br>
*Xetor will shake his head, no.<br>
>
>**Xetor**: How is this possible? How? How.. it doesn't make any sense. We had pulled from the future, yes, but time has always been a circle. Time is-<br>
**Falcon**: You pulled from our city and it snagged us in the process.<br>
**Xetor**: It snagged.. Wait.<br>
*Xetor will look towards the Seer's Bowl, and will conjure a circle, and will pull at the edge of the circle, creating a Tear Drop.<br>
>
>*Xetor will look down, new understanding flowing through his mind.<br>
**Xetor**: We had torn a hole, a tear in the tear of time.<br>
**Moe**: But if they're here, Xetor. And if they are what needs to happen for us to have a fighting chance, then maybe this is all for the best? You know, maybe this is the iteration where it works.<br>
**Ahst**: Unless Xetor's wondering if that's what caused this whole thing.<br>
**Xetor**: No, the wheel cannot turn.

Xetor tries to turn the circle, but it is no longer a circle. It is a tear.

>**Moe**: Do we have to remove the imperfection? How do you return it to a circle?<br>
**Xetor**: I can see what must be done now. The amber keeps the sight safe. But I see the folly of my people. The folly of all those that tried to change their fates. The Violet is like you.<br>
>*Xetor will look at the two other colors.<br>
**Xetor**: it does not belong in this world, ‘tis an infection. A sickness. ‘Tis an exception.<br>
**Falcon**: How do we shove it out of this world and back into ours?<br>
**Xetor**: I would imagine with great force.<br>
**Moe**: So we do punch the tear back into a circle.<br>
>
>**Xetor**: This tear... I must discuss with the colors. There is one thing that we can be certain, I am not entirely sure how it all ties together. The weapon at the end to face the Enemy is still there. You will need all the strength that we have. You must finish your journey through the labyrinth.

Ahst wonders if the Mirror Realm, and the Serpent she met are also not from this world.

>*Xetor will stroke his chin.<br>
**Xetor**: There is yet more, on our journey here my sight revealed to me the movement of those that would call themselves heroes. But I see others, I see eyes. Eyes that glow with terrible knowledge, the burden of Violet sight. Some are already here, but the others must venture. Once they are gathered I believe they can be used to reveal a great secret.<br>
**Ahst**: Maybe any of you can help me.<br>
**Ahst** will show the Sun Stone.<br>
**Ahst**: This could help a lot if I could attune to it, but I don't know the fuck I'm doing.<br>
>
>*Xetor will take the stone and look at it.<br>
**Xetor**: Ah yes. The power within this stone is sufficient. It's been some time since I've seen a leylininc condension of this power, of this magnitude. A condension of power, pulsing with life energy, given willful form. The leylines of Kalkatesh are in disarray due to the druids near complete annihilation. They return and fix what they can, but I fear it will take a direct intervention of heroes to set right the leylines.<br>
**Ahst**: By setting them right I could use this to get who I need?<br>
**Xetor**: Indeed. But I have already seen those that move to do just that. In the meantime you must do what duty is laid before you. You must conquer the labyrinth.

Moe will ask start going through the laundry list of questions he had been building for Xetor.
>**Moe**: I'm still getting the hang of my eye. Trying to understand my role in all this, what I should be doing, versus what is reckless to do, and I feel like I didn't get enough of a crash course back when I was training with you. I'm wondering if you could help me understand more of its potentials and dangers.<br>
**Xetor**: I will provide what support I can, but it is time consuming.

## Odin sheds light on the discovery
>**Moe**: I happened to meet Odin, your dad I guess.<br>
**Xetor**: You speak of Odin?<br>
**Moe**: Yeah. He came, while I asked for his help, and to my surprise he showed up on a longship with all of his kin, and they asked our help. His people have gone quite some time without land, without a home. He charged me with helping establish that home, both a suitable place to settle without war, and in exchange they would lend their aid. We had just come from helping free the Vega, I figured why not move them in there too if it made sense. So we called you here then.<br>
**Xetor**: Call him. Call Odin.

Moe will go to the dock to grab Odin.

>**Arcadum**: And thus you summon the presence of Odin.<br>
>
>**Odin**: I hope there is a good reason you have summoned me.<br>
**Moe**: There is indeed, Allfather. One of your children has arrived. A Cyclops by the name of Xetor.<br>
**Odin**: One of my children? Show me.

Moe and Odin will then head over to the rest of the group.
>**Moe**: May I present Xetor, the last of the Cyclops, and of course Odin, the Allfather.<br>
**Odin**: Blood of my Blood, I share with thee this moment. Tell me, do you see it?<br>
**Xetor**: Yes, father. I do. I thought you were dead.<br>
**Odin**: Death, what a strange concept. Here you stand before me, strong. Here you stand before me, ready and willing. My Valkyrie long since hungered for a proper battle. Long since have my Valkyrie been denied what was promised them. My sons and daughters and wife, trapped within a tower shattered beyond. Not. Any. Longer. My people still need a home, but we will not see you lose your home, we shall lift these veils, and I shall face this Enemy with you. Not ragged and cloaked, but in my armor.<br>
>
>**Arcadum**: With that Odin will take off his cloak, and there you will see his ethereal armor, shining with light. His great spear at his side. In the distance the last of the Viaken longships arrive on the shore, and the Valkyries descend from the heavens. And one by one, they take their place to guard camp last stand against all that would challenge it.<br>
>
>Odin's eye shines with the light of the Cyclops, of the first. Thunder cracks across the sky, as Odin's son takes his place. The people smile and cheer as another son takes his place.<br>
>
>Koga and Falcon share a look, and they look upon this Odin. However, they know him by another name. For Odin, when you knew him, was known as the god Tempus.<br>
>
>**Koga**: Someone would definitely want to see this, Falcon.<br>
**Falcon**: Yeah.<br>
**Ahst**: You guys know Odin?<br>
**Falcon**: We know him by a different name.<br>
**Odin**: Indeed you should. For I know the land you are from. It is the same that my children and I have fled to. Consumed and devoured.<br>
**Falcon**: One of your followers is over here as well.<br>
**Koga**: She was our companion, Tatalia. You met her once, we all did.<br>
**Odin**: My memories are jagged, twisted. All I remember is falling through a great hole. But I can feel it. Names have power. My name here is Odin, yet I cannot remember what my name before was. Do you, traveler?<br>
**Falcon and Koga**: Your name was Tempus, the god of Battle and War.<br>
>
>**Arcadum**: With that there is a swirl of might, as Odin's true name is spoken, his form shifts. The forms of his children will shift.  And a pantheon that was once lost returns.<br>
>
>*Odin will look down at his hands.<br>
**Odin**: It is done.<br>
**Koga**: If there are gods from our world here, then are there any other of you?

>**Arcadum**: Now I get to explain. So, the Midgard gods are the gods of Thor and Odin and all of them. They are still those representations of those gods, but they are that way because when the shift happened, when the cyclops stole from time, it wasn't just the humans that were affected. But rather one of their patron deities. So ironically, when the Cyclops first took from the future they also took Odin's eye. Making the first Cyclops.<br>
>
>And from that, all that was shifted to what is. It acted as the anchoring point for all to follow.<br>

Odin and his people still need a home for there to truly be peace with the Viaken. But with his true name spoken Tempus also sees what he once was.

>*Odin will hold his hand to his head and he will say:<br>
**Odin**: So be it. The fates are so very fickle. I remember our meeting. I remember the discussion I had with the Red Knight about your city. I had thought that you would not survive. How painful the realization that I was right, but not in the way that I thought.<br>
>
>It would seem that we are all trapped here, in a world in which I fear we do not truly belong. But you, you carry more of the world before. But why? How? Perhaps it is our deitic connection that makes our souls more malleable. When we fell into the isles we were consumed by survival, and in those many many years we began to be worshipped by those that lived there. How strange. How terribly strange. The memories are contorted with one another. Of Ymir, of Jorgunmandr, of Mystra.<br>
>
>**Ahst**: I've met Jorgunmandr.<br>
**Odin**: Have you?<br>
**Ahst**: He was wounded though.<br>
**Odin**: It seems we have much yet still to research. I shall lend the Valkyries aid. There are questions to answer, questions of myself. I know this more than all, and that is you.<br>
>
>*He will gesture to all of you.<br>
>
>Yet still have greater roles to play. And the two of you, you must make right which is wrong. You must pass your strength, you must take your place as the Prism. I fear that these things will be unfair, but they must be. Xetor.<br>
**Xetor**: Yes father. <br>
**Odin**: Continue to serve what you will. Do one thing for me.<br>
**Xetor**: Anything, father.<br>
**Odin**: Do not peer into the past of my people. You shall see things that will confuse you further, but I believe I know what it means.<br>
**Arcadum**: With that, Odin will simply walk away. Seeking isolation, to understand what he is.<br>

>**Moe**: Was that a good or a bad thing?<br>
**Xetor**: A god is not immune to heavy news. Give him some time, he will be ready to receive what you have gathered.<br>
**Ahst**: We're all still a little star struck, and I appreciate all these revelations. This is our home and we're going to fight for it. If you want to help us help us, or you can just watch us.<br>
**Falcon**: We will most certainly help.<br>

>**Arcadum**: As the two of you speak you feel a third presence. There is a flash of Orange in the nearby trees.<br>
**Arcadum**: Koga and Falcon, do you turn to face your comrade?

And thus Falcon and Koga argue with one another to go speak with the Orange. Have to wait for Alex to be available for that conversation.


## Finishing up
>**Moe**: Can you teach me more Cyclopean?<br>
**Xetor**: As you have become a shaper, yes.<br>
**Moe**: Wanna go to Annareth?<br>
**Xetor**: No, there are things to do.<br>
**Moe**: But it's cool, though.

Xetor will hand Moe a book on basic Cyclopean power words. Moe will complain about wanting to learn the advanced stuff.

>**Xetor**: You think that because you are shaper you can ignore the basic fundamentals of learning?<br>
**Moe**: Course not.<br>
>
>**Moe**: You ever wonder where y'ever came from? The origin of the language of Cyclopean.<br>
**Xetor**: There are many things that I think of. There is one peculiar piece of my memory that I am unsure of. The amber hides many things, it prevents sight, but it also carries with it a trace of occurrences. I was studying these essences trying to make sense of all that has happened. What I have found disturbs me.<br>
>
>It would seem that the amber is connected together, in a way. It is adaptive, changes based on what is affecting it. Or I suppose, what it is effecting. As time went on, as our journey drew closer, my amber samples began to dwindle in their power, in an unequal rate. I sense the power of the Yellow is in jeopardy.<br>
>
>**Moe**: That's the power of Time, right?<br>
**Xetor**: It is connected to the covenant of Time, yes.<br>
**Moe**: What can we do to bolster it? Do we need to seek the god of time?<br>
**Xetor**: Raquel is already doing what she can. I have already pulled some strings, there are other heroes that shall travel to the Yellow, for you must focus upon the labyrinth.

Xetor tells Moe that he'll get the advanced stuff after he masters the basics.


With that the major stuff dies down, and the party asks a few more general questions.
>**Arcadum**: You make a request off an item you want to make, you can request three things you want it to do, and I will make it based around those things. I'll make it the best I can, balanced wise to make the item.

>**Raost** wants to ask Ili'ith about the Vegan insignia from Gambler's Delight.<br>
**Ili**: I know this is of my people, one of the other sea cities, but I don't know which one. I cannot remember.<br>
**Raost**: I've had it with me this whole time, I've considered it a good luck charm.<br>
**Ili**: It is an insignia of one of the houses.<br>
>
>*She will make an etching. There is no description because Arcadum wants an artist to create it.


Wokou is not allowed to join Shadow of Tyre, because Arcadum has something in mind for him already, and Eassemere has been under attack by the Violet.

Wokou's parting gift to Shadow is his birthday 20. 

Raost and Moe want to retrain. Falcon and Koga can retrain them.

End of session.
