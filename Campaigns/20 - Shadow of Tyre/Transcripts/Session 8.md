# Shadow of Tyre -- Session 8
## The Shadow of Tyre

> **Doubt**: Hello again. It has been some time. Yes, I think we have much to speak on, don't you?<br>
**Doubt**: For years I have waited, for years I have wanted. For all of my want and need, it would seem to be denied to me. For a greater being threatens us all, and you have uncovered my little game. Then let us converse, with no illusion, and no precedent, shall we, Azolon, Alexander?<br>
**Arcadum**: And you refract in to Alexander.

Azolon and Doubt will exchange words, Azolon will try banish Doubt.
 
> **Alexander**: What is it you want?<br>
**Doubt**: I wish for all of creation to not be destroyed. It is your arrogance that the good and just are the only ones that wish to live.<br>
**Alexander**: What did you mean when you said blood of my blood?<br>
**Doubt**: Blood of my blood, vision and form, faded, connected... connected.<br>
**Arcadum**: Eustace. Your true sight activates, and you see doubt for who he is. Blood of my blood, vision and form. He is Tyre's Shadow.

> **Alexander**: You were a hero to the people of Glies, you stopped the Ominax! <br>
**Doubt**: Many things are done in the name of-<br>
**Alexander**: Years will pass, my blood will come, the chains of gods will be undone. Suffer not their scourging mark, for justice comes in the dark.<br>
**Doubt**: You remember.<br>
**Arcadum**: Doubt will fade as the power words are spoken, and what remains behind is the Shadow of Tyre.<br>

The Shadow of Tyre takes the place of a key. It's just a key laying on the tent floor, and within it is in the symbol in the language of Glies, specifically of the Ominax, it says "Shadow".

**Raost** will grab the key.

> **Arcadum**:As you grab the key a vision appears in your mind, floor after floor of the labyrinth, then at the end a final door. A door with three keyholes, and on the other side you can feel it. The madness, the regret, the sorrow, the knowledge, the untapped strength of Tyre, and behind that a weapon against the Enemy. 

> **Braktor**: That makes sense I suppose, Doubt is a sure road to regret.


## The Black and White Tree

> **Ozzie Prayer 1**: Dear Lorn, lord of decay, take into your kindness the empty vessel of this druid who sought the natural order of creation. Allow him to feed the soil, his end becoming a new beginning in the eternal cycle of life and death.<br>
**Ozzie Prayer 2**: Dear Lorn, Lord of Decay, take into your kindness the sisters of this young woman and see that they peacefully return to the soil to create new life and brightness as they brought into Ahst in their time in this world.<br>

Faith check: `D20+13=20`

> **Arcadum**: Around the stone cairn roots will begin to twist and a tree will grow. The tree will bear with it white bark and white leaves. Around it the soil will turn to a deep black, a monochromatic representation...Excuse me the bark is brown but all the leaves that would be green are white and the earth around it is black.

Ozzie gets Seren, as he leaves he refracts to Rannek (human form). Braktor goes. Scene with those in the tent.

> **Arcadum**: Over here we enter a fucked up scene. The tree grows up out of the stone cairn.The brown bark and wood, the white leaves and the black earth and Braktor, Sean, you know what that looks like right?<br>
**Sean**: Yeah.<br>
**Arcadum**: Okay, well have your reaction then.<br>
**Ronnie**: Seeing the look on Braktor’s face Ozzie’s going to be like "oh god did I fuck up again?"<br>

> **Braktor**: this is where you buried Benny, what happened?<br>
**Ozzie**: What happened? I just did my prayers and then tree, weird tree. And I’m not good at nature which is weird. But like...<br>

> **Braktor**: Well I’m not, not anymore. You know that place, um, we’re you there when that lady showed up and gave us that key to go to the important place.<br>
**Ozzie**: Key? What Lady? Refresh my bird brain.<br>
**Braktor**: The Wizard that gave me a hug.<br>
**Ozzie**: you’re going to have to be more specific. I feel like there’s been like four wizards hugging you.<br>
**Seren**: Minthis?<br>
**Braktor**: Yeah, Oi<br>
**Ozzie**: Yeah.<br>
**Braktor**: She gave us a key to unlock a book that tells us how to go to a station. A very important station.<br>

Ozzie mentions her gnome hatred.

> **Braktor**: Don’t know if you know who was experimenting on poor Benny but the soil and the leaves, that’s what they look like in the station and we need to go there eventually.<br>
**Ozzie**: Do you think we should exhume him? I mean I hate to do that but if he’s tainting the Earth.<br>

Braktor touches the tree gingerly. Arcadum types to Sean.

> **Braktor**: It’s not a stopping place. A landmass made to hold something very very important: a single light struggling against the darkness. <br>
**Ozzie**: You’re going to have to dumb it down for me.<br>
**Braktor**: We need to go there and we need to find what’s there. I need to find what’s there. I left something behind that is very important.<br>
**Ozzie**: What does that have to do with me, and what we're doing here?<br>
**Braktor**: I don’t know. All I can say is you know who, the big lad who just had a conniption in one of our tents, if he was experimenting on this boy he may have sent him some very unsafe places.  <br>

Ozzie says he’ll keep an eye on it.

> **Braktor**: You should understand something. The Station was not a safe haven. It’s a place where one goes to atone for their crimes. 

Cue Blackbriar talk

> **Braktor**: No it’s not you’d have to do something far worse...<br>
**Ozzie**: Then I’m in the clear <br>
**Braktor**: Yes. For all the stern and consequences Ozzie. You are a good person and while I think your moroseness sometimes blinds you to that, you always try to do what’s right for the little person. And what you’ve done here I don’t think is cursed I think it’s something that’s given us a chance.<br>
**Ozzie**: Oh, this could be a good tree.<br>
**Braktor**: Like I said the Station was never a place of Evil, it was a place of desperation.<br>

Braktor compliments Ozzie.

> **Braktor**: Ozzie It’s alright. If anyone already doesn’t understand then they will come to understand that you take risks because losing a little bit is worse than losing everything. Don’t beat yourself up for mistakes. Believe me we’ll all make plenty of them. And if we’re going to be in a contest about it we’ll all lose so, you know. You got to pick yourself up and move on when you mess up. That’s the only way any of this is going to stop. If you quit the flame of hope dies out and we’ve already lost.<br>
**Ozzie**: that’s sound all super heroic.<br>
**Braktor**: That’s not heroic. You know what heroes do, they fuckin' quit. Because shits not up to their expectations. They’re not shining knights slaying dragons and rescuing maidens. Heroes do bad shit because they protect people from what is worse.<br>
**Braktor**: I look at all this and see my mistakes and when I see you all suffer and become mutilated and take on burdens. It’s, these are things I should have prevented and you all should have lived happy lives not burdened by nonexistence.<br>

Ahst takes Braktor away.
