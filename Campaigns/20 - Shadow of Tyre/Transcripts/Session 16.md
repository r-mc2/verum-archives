## Relevant Lore

### Moe Checks on Odin

> **Odin**: What is it that you want Seer?<br>
**Moe**: The only thing we're missing is a Genesis Seed.<br>
**Odin**: They are called something different in the Yggdrasil isles, but I think so.<br>
**Moe**: how did you fare in the attack?<br>
**Odin**: I lost many of my valkyries. Their deaths, they were denied entry into Valhalla. I have failed my people this day, this threat. I shall not do so again.<br>
**Moe**: We scared off the creature, but I believe he will be back, and better prepared. I would like you to prepare as well, I know there is that trial, is that something we should still do?<br>
**Odin**: For now we should do a logistical sweep.<br>
**Odin**: It is taking all of my willpower to maintain the vessel upon the ship.


### Party Checks on The White Terror

There were three assailants that tried to attack the white terror, and they failed to do so. They are dead, but there are no bodies, and no traces aside from the scorch marks.

> **Ahst**: So where’s the bodies then?<br>
**White Terror**: They attempted to attack me, so I reduced them down to their essence, and separated them into the sea.<br>
**Ahst**: What attempted to attack you?<br>
**White Terror**: Acolytes of this… creature.<br>

> **Ahst**: How many is “a few sacrifices?”<br>
**White Terror**: A hundred or so? A few years ago.<br>
**White Terror**: Free me or do not free me, neither matters, for in the end I will be free. For your jailers will fail, your bars will shatter, and I will face the enemy on my own if need be.<br>

> **Moe** power word knowledge’s the White Terror, nothing will happen. The word did not come out, Moe's power did not come out.<br>
**White Terror**: The words of power have no effect in my presence.

> **Party**: The only thing that attacked you was three acolytes?<br>
**White Terror**: They were not acolytes. They were servants.

> **White Terror**: I sacrificed no one. I took no innocent life. It is the cost of knowledge.<br>
**Moe**: What knowledge?<br>
**White Terror**: Knowledge of our Enemy.

Eustace true sights the White Terror, and sees exactly the same thing, no changes.

> **Toot**: Do you have a Genesis Seed?<br>
**White Terror**: I know of such a seed. A genesis seed. A difficult artifact to create. Even more difficult to command the power of.<br>
**White Terror**: Why do you ask, exactly?<br>
**Moe**: From our knowledge it's kind of a finite amount.<br>
**White Terror**: Very well. There are yet some places that fragments of the world tree can be found. From the first planting of the world seed in Kalkatesh thousands of years ago. You could seek these places out, and strengthen the stream of life. Listen well. The Genesis Seed is a precious, precious thing to find. It is a piece of not only the physical tree, but also a representation of the portal of life, swirling from one to another. I have no knowledge that can help, simply the Genesis Seeds are rare, if you do collect them be sure to use them wisely.

> **Party**: Where are you gonna go if we free you?<br>
**White Terror**: Below. I have no intention of leaving this place once I'm free.<br>
**Raost**: So you're gonna stay here, just in the water?<br>
**White Terror**: Yes.<br>
**Party**: How far below, there's sort of a situation in the surrounding ocean.<br>
**White Terror**: One threat at a time.<br>
**Moe**: Well it is the same threat, actually.

Insight check to verify intentions, 19 from Moe. No deceit detected.

> **Raost**: What's down there? Are you just gonna sleep or what? Is there something down there we should know about?<br>
**White Terror**: I must return to the deeps, I must inform the Master of what has happened. And then, perhaps, I can return to the surface.<br>
**Moe**: Let's talk about this master, who?<br>
***Arcadum** checks the deep lore.<br>
**White Terror**: My master is the bound one below, the sleeper in the depths, the Sunken King.<br>
**Raost**: Does he have a name?<br>
**White Terror**: This one does not know his name<br>
**Eustace**: What's your name?<br>
**White Terror**: That is one lies below, that is whom I must contact. Whom I must speak with. It has been too long as it is.<br>
**Moe**: How long has it been?<br>
**White Terror**: Hundreds of years.<br>
**Ahst**: What's your name? What do we call you?<br>
**White Terror**: This one is referred to as the White Terror.<br>
**Ahst**: What is your actual name?<br>
**Raost**: Tell us now or your name is Terry from now on.<br>
***Toot** speaks<br>
**\*Arcadum** rolls several times for *Enemy Voice*, lowest roll is a 3. This is the first &lt; 5 roll.<br>

There is a flash of violet light and the creature will grab it in the air, and snuff it out.

> **White Terror**: You play a dangerous game, Kenku.<br>
**White Terror**: But it is safe to speak in my presence.<br>
**Moe**: What did you do, Toot?<br>
**Ahst**: What the hell was that?

> **Party**: You dodged the question, what was your name?<br>
**White Terror**: Very well. If you must know, my name is Dellanaanus.<br>
**Toot**: (*to the White Terror*) I trust you.<br>
**White Terror**: So be it then.<br>
**Ahst**: Can you help him in some way?<br>
***Ahst** points at Toot<br>
**Moe**: Can you explain what that was?<br>
**White Terror**: It would seem as this one's voice, having been restored, has been restored with a terrible curse. The Violet has infected his voice.<br>
**Ahst**: Can it hear us, or can it just talk at random about random shit?<br>
**White Terror**: I do not know the specifics of it, only what is and what is not. To speak with such a voice is too much risk, but here, I suppose, you are protected to do so.<br>
**Moe**: Do you have any ideas on how to cure this curse?<br>
**Toot**: What do you mean, are you saying that I'm still cursed after all?

The creature does not respond to that.

> **Ahst**: Is there a way we can call on you, if we need you?<br>
**White Terror**: This one will be here.

> **Strippin (Ahst)**: The bars are still portals, right?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yes.<br>
***Ahst** closes the bars, and the creature does not move.<br>
**White Terror**: I am free then, good. I shall return soon.

---

Moe and Toot have a heartfelt moment on the docks at the edge of camp regarding his new curse, and how they can work with it going forward.

---

Party talks with Mirage. Mirage tells them she can buff them, expedition long buff.

### Moe's Cyclopean Vision of Mirage

> ***Moe** cyclops eyes Mirage<br>
> **Arcadum**: The first thing that you notice is that, strangely, she is bright and difficult to look at. She thrums with so much of the lifestream, as she's kind of wading through a river of it constantly. You see images of her past, present, and future.<br>
In the past you can see images of her dancing with her sisters in Majital, gathering wayward travelers from the road, and feeding off of their happiness before they perish from normal means.<br>
...She stands with Inu and the lifestream, she sings one of the four chords, the chord of Freedom.<br>
Future. You see the infinite waves, deep, deep beneath them. The heavy waters, the dark abysses, and then you see her, singing with two others whose faces are obscured. And a being deep below that should be kept sleeping awakens instead.

The statement is that Moe thinks the being should be kept asleep. Dangerous at the very least.

---

Toot gets a potion of brain speak (telepathy) that lasts 1h from Igor.

### Return to Eassemere

Group goes back to Eassemere & invites the council to join them in camp, however, Eassemere requires constant upkeep, else the Taladonic runes fail/degrade so they are unable to leave.

#### Shadow's Audience w/ The Council

> **Ahst**: Let's talk tapestries, you've got a couple, yeah? We need to borrow a couple of your tapestries from the hall of mirrors. We were sent here to get it, cause we need it for super secret stuff to save the world.<br>
**Wokou**: You may borrow the tapestry so long as it does not come to harm. Also we shall send delegates to increase trade between the encampment and Eassemere.

Party says they need help guarding the camp. Wokou volunteers to go to camp and (ANUBIS GETS TO PLAY LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO).

---

The party splits up to cover the last errands they wanted to complete in Eassemere.

#### Moe &amp; Raost Go to the Library

Moe wants to learn power words.<br>
Raost wants to learn about Omen, the library has no info on Omen.

You discover one word in Orcish, and it is called "Norsfound"(sp?). Which means stand up. Whenever this word is spoken, within one round of whenever the target goes unconscious whenever an ally becomes defeated, and you have not been defeated, you may speak this power word, and if you do the blazing example of your strength inspires them to stand up again. Takes a dying, downed, or unconscious person, and heals them for 4d6. Does not work on prone people

Eassemere has a very large section on the Vega.

#### Toot &amp; Eustace Go to the Market

Eustace picks up his robe from the market:

**Warrior's Regalia**: +1 to AC, +10 to Movement, and once per round, whenever you are attacked with a ranged attack you may perform Deflect Missile for free.<br>
Sewn ice crystal into the collar and the robes frayed parts around the arm-holes. Gives [1d6] cold damage to every melee attack, period. But, if you critically hit with any martial arts attack, you may immediately use a ki point and cast Burning Hands and deal cold damage instead, the ability name is Freezing Sweep.


Delaron Puce says that a phoenix feather could cure all diseases, and might be able to help Toot with his new affliction.
Delaron Puce: Phoenix's have been extinct for some time, ironic I believe. Some of their feathers have survived, but I for the life of me do not know where.

#### Ahst Goes to the Hall of Mirrors

> **Tomen**: Know this, soon the third will make their way to you, and the gate to the Vega will open.<br>
**Tomen**: There is something else you must also be aware of. The attack on you will not be the last. I have heard whispers through my mirrors, I think I know when the next one is coming. The next attack will be (OOC: November 21st).

### Visit to Inu

After the party returns to camp Ahst, Belanovan, Braktor, and Mirage decide to visit Inu.

> **Inu**: You've done very well, Chord, and now, the song can be repaired, the shattered gates can be healed. Guardians, what brings you back?<br>
**Ahst**: We barely just survived a Violet attack, there's another one coming around the corner, I don't know the fuck i'm doing, and where's that third statue?<br>
**Inu**: The third bearer of the Song Blades is currently lost, hurtling, at a degree that I cannot catch him.<br>
**Ahst**: You've gotta be shitting me.<br>
**Inu**: But fear not, soon the third will join us.<br>
**Ahst**: Okay, but we don't have soon, can you show us what to do with these?<br>
**Inu**: The third must be joined, but fear not, for as you learn to wield the strands of life, so too will you learn to pluck the chords.<br>
**Ahst**: We don't know how to wield the strands of life, Inu.<br>
**Inu**: You do not, but the Weaver will show you the way, and the Chord will provide the resonant tone.

Party bickers.

> **Ahst**: Teach me.<br>
**Braktor**: Teach you what?<br>
**Ahst**: See, you don’t even know the fuck you’re doing.<br>
**Braktor**: It’s not my fault you’re a bad student.<br>
**Inu**: Please have peace, the third songblade will be recovered, the third guardian will be returned. That which was broken will be made whole once more. This is a time of rejoicing, the song is soon to return.<br>
**Ahst**: Inu clearly hasn’t seen our camp, he’s overjoyed about the idea of song.<br>
**Inu**: I have seen the camp, I saw what had transpired. I saw your victory, your faith in one another. It is true that I can seem aloof or cruel, for my sight is not for the individual, but for all living things. I am afraid that it is a view that you will have to adopt eventually, for you carry a great burden upon your shoulders, one that many others will not understand.<br>
**Mirage**: Is there anything I can do to help strengthen their abilities while the other is gone?<br>
**Inu**: Practice your song, Siren, write your music. For when the time comes it may be the only thing that holds back the Violet.

Braktor informs Inu of the song of the Seven, and that it needs to be played only at the end, and that it'll need all of them.
> **Inu**: Indeed, just like it had been before.

> **Inu**: Fear not, when the third is made, you shall be contacted. And the latent power within the blades shall awaken themselves, no matter where you may be.<br>

Braktor inquires about crafting with Life Stands:
> **Braktor**: Not soul energy, but the energy of the weaves. Can I use those to make things? One of my companions was gravely injured, and I would like to see that they are better protected against the horrors of the Enemy.<br>
**Inu**: The creation of items of magic using strands is very difficult even for one such as I, it takes a specialist, and you are yet still a novice.

Mirage joins Shadow in the labyrinth, and the session ends.
