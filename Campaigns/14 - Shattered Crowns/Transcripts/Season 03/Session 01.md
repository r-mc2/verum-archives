## Relevant Lore

### Previously On...

But in seriousness, the group is caught up on events that occured between seasons. The party has been flying through the Astral Sea heading back towards the planet Verum, studying up on the various planets, and educating themselves on basic ship systems.

During the trip, the ship flew close by the Lifestream and Guy vanished (off to Soul of Tyre for all those shenanigans) for a day. He eventually returned with his blade glowing brighter than before, however he chose not to share much about what happened to him during his abscense. It is also revealed that, including their departure from Kalkatesh in the "Fireball Incident" up until now it has been 24 days in-universe.

Whilst flying around they finally check their cargo hold and find terraforming equipment. The ship is laden with equipment to build a colony. Alternatively they could use the equipment to add to/repair the ship.

Eventually in need of fuel they end up careening into the floating rocks that make up the Red Star of Annareth.

Something is knocking on the outside of the ship, requesting entry.

### The Red Star

After some diliberation with Sai on "proper space etiquette" on receiving a visitor, the party decides to recieve this unknown visitor on the bridge. Eventually, Vinnidinci Vaskael Valakain Beatorix Mateslayer (a.k.a. "Beatorix" or "Rixie") makes her way to them and introduces herself.

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tkAQOGY.jpg" alt="Beatorix's Handout Art" height="350px" />](https://i.imgur.com/tkAQOGY.jpg)

Through some religion checks it is revealed that she is of the Shar'kai, the Ash Elves. They are a warrior race and should be treated with respect.

She introduces herself:

> **Beatorix**: Greetings to you travelers, I am Vinnidinci Vaskael Valakain Beatorix Mateslayer and I am the honored mate of one known as Moe Kowbull, the Shaper of this realm.

The party introduces themselves, in a way only this party can do, and asks for some information about their current location. Beatorix invites them to come up and see for themselves.

> **Beatorix**: To be clear, my husband has informed me that you are to be treated iwth kindness. He is currently away on important business so I shall be your guide and your host. Normally our business would conclude with food and water and shelter, but it would seem there are greater conversations for us to share. For whilst my husband was away and between the time of me speaking with you the Red Star has spoken with me. There are whispers in my mind that tell me to bring you inside. Something wishes to speak with you.<br>
**Huck**: Uh, something? Or someone?<br>
**Beatorix**: I do not know if this stone is a person or not. But it calls just the same.

Approaching the front door Bahroo recognizes the door as something potentially from or resembling (i.e. "a reused asset") the Elven construction of the Lord of Flowing Water's temple. Arcadum is impressed he would recognize it and invites him to make a roll.

(Pipe Arcana: (`18`))

Arcadum reveals that while it is not of the same materials it is definitely of construction that would match what they have seen previously and that this door and the ones previously seen are connected some how, but Pipe would not know why.

Iron Pipe asks Guy for their Inheritor Staff and brings up the door:

> **Iron Pipe**: This door is very similar to a door we saw on Kalkatesh in the Lord of Flowing Water ruins. There was a phrase that we could use and I was genuinely curious if these were connected at all. Normally, all it would do is open the door, but I have to know. But not without your approval first. I wouldn't do anything stupid.<br>
**Beatorix**: And what phrase is that?<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Babbabooey.<br>
**Arcadum**: As you speak Babbabooey there is a flash of red energy that surrounds Iron Pipe. Beatorix will raise an eyebrow and the energy will course through the door. The runes will begin to alight all along the stone. Words that were not there before.

> **Bahroo (Iron Pipe)**: Can I read them?<br>
**Arcadum**: No, they are written in a language you do not understand.

> **Arcadum**: Beatorix moves her hand over the stone haphazardly and will look back towards Iron Pipe:<br>
**Beatorix**: How? How do you know this word?<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Well, we were asked to create a sort of a passphrase for this staff and we collectively decided that should be the phrase.<br>
**Beatorix**: To speak a word of power is a dangerous thing.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: A word of pow- We made it up as a joke!<br>
**Beatorix**: And yet, power it still holds.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Could it be because we're all an ancient elf that's dead now?<br>
**Beatorix**: That would be ironic. But, it is more likey the strength of the staff of which you wield.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: So you're saying the word itself is powerful? Not just the st-<br>
**Beatorix**: Indeed, the word- the Power Words, as they're called in the Common tongue, or True Speech, whichever way that you wish to look at it. There are many such words that exist in many languages. My own language, Shar'kai, has them as well. But the word that you speak is of one that you say that you created; made up. And yet power it holds just the same. 'Tis the curious nature of such things that even something as mecurial or mundane as a simple funny word can hold within it such strength.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Well, the thing is the staff used to have a different phrase to awaken its power.<br>
**Beatorix**: Do you know what that is?<br>
***Iron Pipe** throws Ikkar "under the bus"

(For those curious, the word is in [S01-E08](../Season%2001/Session%2008.md) -- "`Nataris Nedelikir`")

The party is unable to recall the word and is invited inside by Beatorix.

> **Iron Pipe**: I see you like the color red.<br>
**Beatorix**: 'Tis not my liking of the color red. 'Tis the power of the Red Star. There are many questions I'm sure you will have, but I will not be the one to answer them. There is something else that-<br>
**Arcadum**: And you notice that the more she speaks the more- you don't know her, but you can tell there's something, ironically, robotic about her movements. Almost as if she is being pulled.<br>
**Huck**: You feelin' alright there, ma'am?<br>
**Arcadum**: She will nod, but not respond and lead you [up the stairs].

---

#### The Spell Forge

Iron Pipe and the others follow Beatorix into the adjoining room to the east and given the nature of the room Bahroo immediately needs to make some rolls:

(Perception: `14` & Charisma Save: `15(12)`)

> **Arcadum**: That is a spell creation forge. Where a wizard could create spells of their own making. Like your oratory, only several, several, several times more sophisticated. The charisma save was to hide your errection. Well done.

Pipe moves towards the forge in a trance, the others corral him away from it to keep them focused on following Beatorix.

### The Red Pantheon

Heading up to the second floor Ikkar and Huck spot a mosaic on the floor.

> **Arcadum**: It depicts six maidens standing around a central feminine figure. One of the maidens is brightly lit; color shining from her face.

Ikkar walks up thinking he spots some writing on the mosaic but (with a `1` on Invesigation) turns out it's just some fanciness in the design. Huck, thinking he may spot something, and wanting to show off how literate he is takes a look too.

(Invesigation: `19`)

> **Arcadum**: Huckleberry, you may not be much of a religious man, but as you take a closer look you swear you've seen something like this in the church of Iass. The mosaic represents different aspects of a pantheon, but it's no pantheon you've ever seen. The six maidens seem to incorporate around a central maiden, each of them subservient to the center. There appear to be seven maidens in total.<br>
**Huck**: (to Ikkar) Well it looks like those fillies are all serving the one in the center.<br>
**Ikkar**: I sort of remember, I did find a curious tome in the library back with Lord Arendell, if you remember. And there were six names: Rentoss, Haates, Dailos, Verza, Kasaka, and Jhasa. I think the last one, the seventh, might be Lucy, but I'm not sure.<br>
**Arcadum**: As you speak the names there is a slight glow in the mosaic with each name that you name. And with it the stone edificies begin to glow brightly. (And now I get to reveal for the first time the visuals of the [Red Pantheon](../../../../Lore/Deities%20%26%20Pantheons/Red%20Pantheon.md))

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hPbp3OQ.png" alt="The Mosaic & The Maidens" height="350px" />](https://i.imgur.com/hPbp3OQ.png)

### A Shaper Portal

After their fun with trying different words and seeing what may or may not light something up, the party heads onwards to the next staircase.

(Note: Likely just a meme Arcadum was playing along with, as they were saying eachother's names he indicated that there was a slight light about each character as their name was mentioned. Possibly some hint at names being power words in general, but likely just jokes and fun.)

In the room immediately to the north the party finds a strange portal emanating a large amount of energy and all sorts of arcane paraphernalia.

> **Arcadum**: But Beatorix continues her strange, clouded stroll up the stairs.<br>
**Huck**: Hey, Bea, what's that portal for?<br>
**Beatorix**: My husband uses it to traverse the worlds.<br>
**Huck**: Oh? So that's connected to a bunch of other places?<br>
**Beatorix**: It is supposed to be, but the words must be remembered.

Ikkar decides to investigate one of the tables:<br>
[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/g5B4tlB.jpg" alt="Table of Notes" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/g5B4tlB.jpg)

> **Arcadum**: This is specifically a guide on how to avoid sickness on instantaneous transportation.

Scrumpo, also feeling curious, looks at the arcane paraphernalia on the nearby table:<br>
[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TOLZukd.jpg" alt="Arcane Paraphernalia & Reagents" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/TOLZukd.jpg)

> **Arcadum**: There is gold, silver, a small pouch which seems to be behind a glass case.<br>
As you open the case and look inside the pouch you see what looks like a glittery dust.<br>
***Scrumpo** puts it back

### The Top Floor

Eventually, the party is lead all the way up to the top floor.

> **Arcadum**: And here she will bring you before a great machine before she nods at the machine and begins to walk away.<br>
***Scrumpo** attempts to stop her.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Hey. Hey. Hey.<br>
***Beatorix** will look down at him.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Are you being mind controlled?<br>
**Beatorix**: What is to be said? My ears are not to hear.

Concerned this may be malicious Scrumpo and Pipe make some checks.

(Scrumpo medicine: `16(15)` & arcana: `18(11)`. Pipe arcana: `21(14)`)

> **Arcadum**: The two of you squint at Beatorix and she is certainly having her actions influenced. But, you get feeling that it isn't malicious, in fact, it's almost protective. The magic gives off a sense of a mother shooing a daughter away from a horrid scene.

Returning to the machine:

> **Arcadum**: A bright red light will emanate from the strange machine and then from Iron Pipe's armor something will appear.<br>
**Drifter Sai**: Greetings my lords, I-<br>
***Drifter Sai** shifts his gaze towards the machine.<br>
**Drifter Sai**: HOLY SHIT!<br>
**Ikkar**: Yep.<br>
**Huck**: Everything okay? We just got brought here?<br>
**Guy**: Aren't you supposed to be defending our thingy?<br>
**Ikkar**: Yea. Who's on the ship?<br>
**Iron Pipe**: How'd you come out of my armor?<br>
**Drifter Sai**: Well, *I*, m'lords, posess the ability to be in two places at once!<br>

(Insert continued joke about "two of yourself" and "pleasure" 😉)

### The Astral Traveller

> **Drifter Sai**: My lords. That is an- that is a navigational array!<br>
**Huck**: Uh, pardon?<br>
**Drifter Sai**: An advanced one. Far beyond the capabilities of our vessel and perhaps even beyond my capabilities.<br>
**Guy**: So, can we get it on the ship?<br>
**Drifter Sai**: Well, we would not be able to fit it my lords. It seems that one can use [the control panel on the front] to control it. One of you corporeals will have to do that though.<br>
***Scrumpo** places his hand on the device aided by Guy (he's short after all).<br>
**Arcadum**: As you place your hands upon the strange emerald gem it will begin to glow and the array will whir to life. Drifter Sai will suddenly appear beside you staring up. His eyes flashing with lights, numbers, sigils, markings. And the great device will begin to shift and change position interacting with Drifter Sai. And he will point at it and say:<br>
**Drifter Sai**: It's- it's... Mother.<br>
**Huck**: Excuse me?<br>
**Arcadum**: And there within the swirling navigational array you will see the six maidens and above them the Astral Traveller. And within it the stars of light will show a line of travel. Now, even though you are from a medieval world you know what that is because you've seen them on sea charts. That is a course. And it seems it has been plotted by the Astral Traveller herself.
>
> The visage of the Astral Traveller will gesture her hand towards Drifter Sai whose eyes will begin to glow a soft red.<br>
**Drifter Sai**: Coordinates received.<br>
**Huck**: Where are we going?<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Well we're going through space, obviously.<br>
**Huck**: Well, I knew that, but I mean to h'where?<br>
**Iron Pipe**: I'unno.<br>
**Arcadum**: As you see the plotted course you can see that it takes you to the following planets:
>
> Solarity, Loolqua, Ori, Rampart, Maltos, & The Twilight Station
>
> Each of these planets are connected in a long spindle-spiral. The map indicates that you could approach them from many different directions. And you find your self near the edge. Specifically, you can see where Kalkatesh is and the Red Star is not that far away. Kalkatesh is also connected to this ring of maps.
>
> So, it seems whomever this Astral Traveller is has sent you coordinates and you recognize the color that emanated from the map room the first time you entered the vessel. Drifter Sai will look down, his normal temptous, sassy behavior muted. And it will say:<br>
**Drifter Sai**: The Mother wishes for us to travel. The vessel must stay the course. The Enemy must be stopped.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: So, does that mean we're going somewhere other than where you originally intended?<br>
**Drifter Sai**: Original intention, the map, these things are the same.<br>
**Ikkar**: I mean, we were intending to go to Maltos eventually. Weren't we?<br>
**Scrumpo**: That was our final goal.<br>
**Ikkar**: Well, now we've got a map.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Well, that'll probably make travelling there much faster.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Drifter Sai, why do we have to stop at all these other places before we get there?<br>
**Drifter Sai**: You do not have to stop there. Mother suggests that you do. Strength, fuel, supplies, power; these are needed before the trip to Maltos. There are many things Mother says. This one- difficulty to hold... Mother's thoughts are many and wide.<br>
**Ikkar**: Any suggestion for a first stop?<br>
**Scrumpo**: We should go to the first place in the spiral.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Does Mother have a name or is it just "Mother"?<br>
**Drifter Sai**: "Mother" is not Mother's name. Mother is title. Title to Angels such as I, such as this one was. It is the Astral T-T-Traveller.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Well, if she says we should follow this little cycle, I don't see why not.<br>

Some further deliberation on supplies, where to go first, which planets are close, and some concern about Beatorix, the party chit-chats a bit before:

> **Scrumpo**: Drifter Sai, do you have any other information on why we should be going to these places? What should we be looking for when we go there?<br>
**Drifter Sai**: Mother says there are pieces not yet gathered. Things that could increase your chances of survival.<br>
**Arcadum**: The Astral Traveller will look down upon you with a sad face.<br>
**Drifter Sai**: She knows your burden. She wishes f-f-for it to be lessened.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Well, I don't want to die.<br>
**Scrumpo**: As long as we have some way of knowing what we're looking for, this will be easy for us.<br>
**Drifter Sai**: Mother says you need much fuel, you need strength. You must gather the shattered realms of- the pieces of-<br>
**Arcadum**: Drifter Sai will start to buckle and the red light leaves his eyes and falls to the ground.<br>
***Iron Pipe** moves over to him.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Are you okay?<br>
**Arcadum**: The intangible being just lays there and then, the Astral Traveller will fully manifest.

> **Octo (Huck)**: Like it doesn't look like a hologram? It looks like an actual person standing here?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yea, well, as far as you know.

> **Arcadum**: And as the Astral Traveller fully manifests there is a calm, soothing light that fills the room followed by a strange feeling. A feeling of almost like a forgetfulness. She looks upon you with a soft, kindly gaze sparing Drifter Sai any further burden of the knowledge that she holds. She will look upon Scrumpo and awaits your question.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Who the hell are you?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: I am the Astral Traveller. Who are you?<br>
**Scrumpo**: We're the Lords of Flowing Water!<br>
**Arcadum**: The Astral Traveller's gaze looks beyond what you are and sees the refractions. You are more than the Lords of some desert. As the Astral Traveller gazes upon you she sees the markings of Taladon, in service to the Scarab Lords, so too over the many generations of arcane study do you bear the lineage of Taladon's Folly and the fall of Maltos.<br>

> **Moon (Scrumpo)**: All of us?!<br>
**Arcadum**: All of you.<br>
**Moon (Scrumpo)**: Okay, and that's specifically because we're Inheritors?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yup.

> **Scrumpo**: So, that lady that was wandering around and showed us here, she looked pretty bad ass. Is she like your slave or something? Also, where's Moe Kowbull?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: She needed not hear what was said.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Oh, alright. Hey, nice place you got here. Our ship is kinda screwed up. You got any idea with how we can start with repairing the different facilities that are damaged?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: The power of the Red Star will see your vessel revived.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Quick question. How old are you?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: You should never ask a lady her age.<br>
**Huck**: Scrumpo, you never ask a woman her age! C'mon, that's rude.<br>
**Scrumpo**: I'm trying to figure out if she's a primordial force or some shit. Something more powerful than a god or something. What are you?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: I am one of the first to travel throughout.<br>
**Scrumpo**: What?! You said you're one of the first?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: I am one of the first.<br>
**Scrumpo**: What do you know about Shrouds? If she's really one of the first she'd know what a Shroud is.<br>
**Astral Traveller**: Echoes of those forgotten. Whispers of the dead before The Wheel's turning.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Alright, seems like you're some sort of force in the Universe so I feel it prudent to mention we have a piece of The Enemy on the vessel that you probably should not merge with it now, whatever the hell you're gonna do.<br>
***Scrumpo** looks to the others.<br>
**Guy**: You plotted this whole course for us to gain power before we end up at Maltos?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: Correct.<br>
**Guy**: Okay, so could I drink you blood?<br>
**Huck**: Scrumpo, the two things I've learned about women: one is you don't ask their age, and two is you don't ask to drink their blood. At least not on the first date. Okay? Show some respect.<br>
**Astral Traveller**: I apologize. I do not have blood.<br>
***Guy** sighs.<br>
**Guy**: They never do. Either the blood will blow me up, make me fat, or they don't have it.<br>
**Ikkar**: (to Guy) You've really had a rough run of it.<br>
**Guy**: Oh, I know, Ikkar. Thank you.<br>
**Scrumpo**: So can we take whatever we want from this place to help us?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: The things here are for the Shapers. I have prepared the supplies you'll need.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: That's fair. I noticed there was a machine just a few floors down for creating spells. Do you mind if I take a look at that?<br>
**Guy**: You had one of those back home.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Yea, but this one is much better!<br>
**Guy**: You never even looked at it! Do you really want me to bring up this Undead Labs thing again? 'Cause I haven't let it go.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Well it doesn't matter cause we wouldn't have used the Lab either!<br>
**Guy**: *I* would have.<br>
**Astral Traveller**: Caution with such things, young wizard. There are things your mind is not ready for.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: That's not a "yes" or a "no". Caution is one thing, "no" is another.<br>
**Ikkar**: We don't really have the first thing...<br>
**Arcadum**: The Astral Traveller looks at you with an incredulous look.<br>
**Guy**: Alright, do you want a real question? Are you having fun with these? Cause I never know.<br>
**Astral Traveller**: It's been a while since I've had a visitor.<br>
**Guy**: Alright, I guess we could play cards or something. So, I've got this sword, it's glowing red, you're kinda red. What's up with that?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: It's a Prism blade. One of four.<br>
**Guy**: Is it yours?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: Created when the world shattered and forged into the will/wheel(?). It is not mine.<br>
**Guy**: What relation do you have with the red in the first place?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: The color is that of the being who created me, but not the one who granted me life.<br>
**Guy**: There's two follow up questions there. Which one do you want to answer first?<br>
**Arcadum**: She does not respond.<br>
**Guy**: Alright, who gave you life, if it wasn't clear?<br>
**Arcadum**: There is a flash of violet in the room, the Astral Traveller (*snaps*) dispells it instantly.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Should I be worried about that?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: Careful with your questions, some of them cannot be answered.<br>
**Guy**: Oh, no, I wouldn't worry about that at all. I saw this funky guy *fish* literally with a fishing rod in Violet. Craziest shit I ever saw!<br>
**Ikkar**: There's a portal downstairs somewhere, could we use that to get back to here if, say, we needed more... ambiguous answers?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: Yes, with the proper energy.<br>
**Ikkar**: What proper energy is that?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: The power of your vessel, once prepared, can provide this.<br>
**Ikkar**: Oh, good, good. Is there like a code we need or do we just sort of think it? I just don't want to leave here without knowing how to get back if I needed to.<br>
**Astral Traveller**: It is something that can be prepared through your Angel.<br>
**Ikkar**: Right, we'll talk to Drifter.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Quick question, is there anything you personally want done while we're out there doing stuff? You.<br>
**Astral Traveller**: I feel you should focus on the mission at hand. But, if you could spare any time, you did leave a rather messy situation in the desert.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Oh.<br>
**Ikkar**: Right, yea. There was that, wasn't there?<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Oh, yea.<br>
**Ikkar**: We did send a message back to the Lantern Lighter, so he's probably-<br>
**Iron Pipe**: He probably got that message. He can just go... throw some water on it.<br>
**Scrumpo**: What's going on down there right now?

### Pictures From Home

> **Arcadum**: The Astral Traveller will show you. Conjuring a portal of glass this mirror provides you the ability to gaze upon Lieve and you can see the Lantern Lighter is doing all that he can. Right now, he is preparing the troops of Lieve and putting them to the walls. He is currently hard at work trying to deal with a recent famine.<br>
**Ikkar**: That looks like a siege!<br>
**Huck**: Is everyone okay? Do they have all the free beef jerky that I told 'em to give out?<br>
**Arcadum**: The Astral Traveller will widen the view, pulling like a bird straight up from Lieve, and you will see the continent of Kalkatesh. Violet points of light can be seen like stab wounds upon the continent. Violet energy eeking out from them being surrounded by those that bear the light of the Prism. Colors of Indigo and Green shine brightly across the map and the heroes of Kalkatesh gather their strength.<br>
**Ikkar**: Oh. We really cocked it up, didn't we?<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Did we do this?<br>
**Huck**: Is this our fault?<br>
**Arcadum**: With a simple flick of her wrist the Astral Traveller will show you that whist you contributed to it, this was The Enemy's movements.<br>
**Scrumpo**: So, how can we help?<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Can you show us like, any part of Kalkatesh?<br>
***Astral Traveller** nods her head.<br>
**Astral Traveller**: (to Scrumpo) Complete your mission.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Alright, so we're just gonna leave that there then? Start sailing?

### Ronnie The Dog

> **Iron Pipe**: Well, there is *one* matter. You said that you could see any part of Kalkatesh, about a half-day out from Lieve, towards the shore, there's probably a giant explosion. Can you potentially show us that area?<br>
**Arcadum**: (*snaps*) The area is shown. What you see is not but Violet ash and scorched earth.<br>
***Iron Pipe** lowers his head.<br>
**Huck**: Hey, he was strong. If he's gonna survive, he woulda done it.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: He's gone...<br>
**Huck**: Well, we don't know that. You gotta believe, Pipe.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: There's no believing...he's dead.<br>
**Guy**: Wait. Are you talking about that dog?<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Yes! We're talking about the dog!<br>
**Guy**: Oh my god-<br>
**Iron Pipe**: I finally get to see it with  my own eyes what I did!<br>
**Guy**: What about all the peop- (*sigh*)<br>
**Iron Pipe**: I don't care about the people! They meant nothing to me!<br>
**Guy**: Are we just gonna stand around and sulk? We've got a lot to do.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: *I missed Ronnie*!<br>
**Astral Traveller**: Would you like to see Ronnie?<br>
**Party**: What?!<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Is he... alive?<br>
**Ikkar**: Is it disgusting? 'Cause, no!<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Please! You gotta show him to us!<br>
**Arcadum**: The Astral Traveller will move her hand towards the mirror and will cover it with a red film- with red light and clench her fist and will shift the view. And there in the sands a beast of Violet flames waits for its master's command.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Nooo~<br>
**Huck**: Oh dear...If there's one reason to do our mission, I suppose, it's that.<br>
**Guy**: Oh. You just derailed us so bad, lady. Why'd you show them that?<br>

Some sassy back and forth on whether or not Pipe replaced Ronnie with his suit, as well as if they did stop to fight Ronnie, could he even be saved?

> **Astral Traveller**: Once corrupted, there is no going back.<br>
**Scrumpo**: So, you know of the shark we killed, is ole Ronnie more powerful than the shark?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: No.<br>
**Guy**: Why don't the other colors corrupt people? In, like, a good corruption.<br>
**Huck**: Maybe it's a matter of perspective?<br>
**Scrumpo**: He has a point.<br>
**Astral Traveller**: They are alike in the same way, they can choose champions.<br>
**Guy**: So, why aren't they doing that? We freed- They're out there right?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: They are still being awoken.<br>
**Scrumpo**: Look, we don't need any extra power from colors. We just need ourselves! Let's go kill the dog.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Traveller, I have one final question about Ronnie. It's said that once something gets corrupted like that your memories of it also are gone. If we finish off Ronnie, will we forget what he was before he got corrupted?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: You will forget him completely... normally. But, you are in the presence of an Eye. You will remember, for better, for worse.<br>
**Arcadum**: When she says "worse" you will see her face becomes heavy with sadness.<br>
**Scrumpo**: If she says that thing is weaker than the shark that we killed in The Dream then why don't we just stop by and kill it?

> **Guy**: Astral Traveller, you must know. How many people live on Kalkatesh?<br>
**Arcadum**: The current population of Kalkatesh is: 42,375,316.<br>
**Guy**: I can't even concieve of that number! Why does it have to be one of us?

The party spends a great deal of time debating what to do about Ronnie, finger pointing at the incident, and some self loathing. Should they go after him first, maybe doing a flyby of Kalkatesh and deal with Ronnie? Continue on with their exploration of the other planets? Also, finally, a bit of discussion in-character about what Guy did with Inu (i.e. the discussion about the Songblade Trials). Eventually...

> **Guy**: Alright, Astral Traveller, my last shot in the dark here. What if, and a big what if, what if we were able to sort everything? Fix The Wheel, defeat The Enemy, what happens to Ronnie then?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: I am unsure.<br>
**Guy**: Isn't that hope?

More debating back and forth on Ronnie or the mission. They seem to settle on taking care of Ronnie, then heading off to Rampart. The Astral Traveller will provide them some "quick travel" back and forth to Kalkatesh from the Red Star.

> **Scrumpo**: Alright, I gotta go back to the ship and do something, unless you need something, lady?<br>
**Astral Traveller**: No. That's it.

### An Oath

Unfortunately, even more debating occurs, until:

> **Iron Pipe**: Fine, next time we get into this disagreement I will automatically side with Guy, no matter what it is.<br>
**Guy**: Oh, my *god*, I'm on board now. You have no idea the crazy shit I say in my head and don't say out loud. You have *no* idea what you just signed up for. You can't even fathom-<br>
**Iron Pipe**: It is an oath to you!

> **Arcadum**: Uhhh, hold on please!

The area around Pipe and Guy darkens and Babylon happily accepts the new oath.

> **Arcadum**: Alright, Guy, Iron Pipe, by his oath, will automatically side with you in the next major argument that the party has, on penalty of punnishment of Babylon. The oath is sealed.

### Raquel & The Dilating One

Scrumpo heads back out to the ship and collects the clock they stored some of the Violet energies they got from the flames in Arendell's room and makes a prayer to Raquel:

> **Arcadum**: Alright, Scrumpo, you being to pray to Raquel, but her voice is faint as you are very far away. (Just on the edge of wifi god range 😜)

> **Scrumpo**: Hey, we're back. We made it. I know you probably didn't know where we were, but we were on the other side of the Astral Sea. We made it back and we filled the clock that you gave us with some of The Enemy's essence. I'm going to give it to you like you asked, but you need to be aware that the person we got it from thought that he could control it, but he was wrong and it tricked him into thinking that he could control it. And when his guard was down it basically killed him. If you're going to study this you need to speak with Amber Sky in order to fully research this. You can't do this on your own. I'm afraid it'll trick you like it tricked Arendell and if you die then we're pretty screwed. Amen.<br>
**Raquel**: You have done well, thank you. Oh faithful, with this we may yet study what the pro-<br>
**Arcadum**: Your prayer is cut off. The holy symbol of Raquel that you have in your hand (*snaps*) shatters and melts away in violet light.

> **Moon (Scrumpo)** What about the clock?<br>
**Arcadum**: The clock made its journey. It's there.

> **Arcadum**: And then, Scrumpo, to the eyes of the faithful you see it. A creature pulls itself from the Astral Sea.

The map is covered in Violet light.

> **Arcadum**: And there through the swirling, infinite expanse of the Astra Sea reality shatters as a creature pulls itself free. It appears to be a humanoid creature, it's hair is black and long, it's face is covered in skin where only a mouth remains. Clocks are stabbed into its mottled flesh and it wields a war scythe made from sand that seems to be edged in glass. And, Scrumpo, listen well, for upon its summoning you are so infinitesimally smaller than it is, that it does not even notice your presence and you hear it speak to its master:

> **Dilating One**: My Lord, you have summoned me again, speak your orders and I shall see them done.<br>
**???:** Seek thee the broken pieces. Seek thee that which was lost.
>
> Keep them distracted. My power grows. The noose surrounds them.
>
> Go, my servant, they beckon and bicker amongst themselves.
>
> Kill them all.<br>

> **Arcadum**: The creature turns its head towards Kalkatesh and it drifts over the Red Star. And with an errant brush of its hand bats the pitiful Red light out of its path, cracking the stone as it makes its way towards the world below.

> **Joe (Ikkar)**: Cracking the stone at the center of the thing we're standing on?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yep.<br>
**Bahroo (Iron Pipe)**: What does *that* do?<br>
**Arcadum**: Nothing, yet. That is what you see, Scrumpo.<br>
**Octo (Huck)**: Did we hear any of that, or did we-<br>
**Joe (Ikkar)**: Are we still being hurtled through space?<br>
**Arcadum**: No, all you saw was the Violet light encroach and you see that the Astral Travaller looks up with concern on her face and dissipates from the machine.

Scrumpo chooses to wait outside, but back up in the room with the navigational array:

> **Huck**: Umm, hey. What was that?<br>
**Iron Pipe**: And where's the Traveller?<br>
**Arcadum**: Drifter Sai will stand, his eyes flash red one final time.<br>
**Drifter Sai**: My Lords, she has gone away. She moves so fast. Mother says we cannot waste time, The Enemy's power has grown too great. It summons a second voice.<br>
**Huck**: A second voice? What like another one?<br>
**Drifter Sai**: Two Speakers, those that can speak in its service. With every word they utter its strength grows.<br>
**Huck**: Okay, so w-what do we do? Where-<br>
**Drifter Sai**: We must complete the mission given. I am an instrument to be wielded.<br>
**Huck**: Look, Pipe, I know- I know you wanna go see Ronnie and we will! We will, we have to clean up- Now, Pipe, look, you're a Lord of Flowing Water. Who's a Lord of Flowing Water?<br>
***Iron Pipe** curls up on the floor next to a table.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Ronnie was!<br>
**Huck**: Who else is a Lord of Flowing Water, hmm? It's you. You are.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Alright, fine. Let's go.<br>
**Huck**: Yea, there ya go! That's a Lord of Flowing Water! Let's get outta here.<br>

The party gathers outside with Scrumpo:

> **Scrumpo**: Did you guys see that?!<br>
**Huck**: Well, yea. It was hard to miss!<br>

Scrumpo explains to the party what happened with the prayer and the Dilating One's arrival.

> ***Iron Pipe** knocks on his chestpiece.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Drifter, are you in there?<br>
**Drifter Sai**: Yea.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Is everything good to go? Are we repaired?<br>
**Drifter Sai**: Yea.<br>
**Iron Pipe**: Oh, alright.<br>

And now back on the ship Drifter Sai sets course for Rampart.

### Rampart

The party travels the Astral Sea and makes their way to Rampart. Normally they would have to roll for random encounters, but this one time the gift of the Astral Traveller allows them to skip it.

Eventually, they land on top of an old temple courtyard, a training grounds just outside of a small town known as Oza:

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mlkQ3r3.jpg" alt="The Town of Oza" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/mlkQ3r3.jpg)

The group learns a bit more about their [ship](#vessel-features) and eventually decides to name thier ship "`R/Ive`", pronounced "arrive".

Back to the party they see a group heading towards them and the ship:

> **Arcadum**: The man who approaches you appears to be a samurai warrior, he is about 35, he is somewhat scarred. He has steely blue eyes and his hair is tied up into an elagant topknot. He is flanked by twin constructs made out of jade wielding warglaives. And he approaches the party...

> **Bahroo (Iron Pipe)**: How much time here is one day on Kalkatesh?<br>
**Arcadum**: That I cannot actually answer for you because there is literally an enemy now in the world that can change that.

And with that the session ends.

### Astral Sea Mechanics

Just before departing their ship the group asks for some clarification about the mechanics of space in the Verum setting, in part due to concerns about whether or not there is air in the Astral Sea.

Arcadum goes on to explain:

> **Arcadum**: Editors Note! It is not actually space. It is fantasy space! Meaning you can breathe, however, the problem is that it is *very* cold.<br>
**Joe (Ikkar)**: Is there air? Could Ikkar fly through space?<br>
**Arcadum**: Well, technically speaking there is air, meaning you can breathe, but it is very cold so the coldness of space is still a thing. So, you need to be able to resist the cold to be outside.<br>
Number two, you *can* fly, but not in that way, because the Astral Sea is rife with residual Life energy. So, when you would fly it's not that you would flap your wings and use thrust to gain flight. It is that you believe you can fly and therefore you do.<br>
It is similar to The Dream, except The Dream realm is absolutely ruled by will power, whereas the Astral Sea is not.

> **Bahroo (Iron Pipe)**: If I were to throw a fireball would it go a set distance or would it just keep going?<br>
**Arcadum**: The spell would go up to its set range before detonating, but something like an arrow would keep going until it hit something.
>
> There is no drag- it is frictionless.

> **Moon (Scrumpo)**: How long could we exist in the cold before dying?<br>
**Arcadum**: Life energy produces a residual amount of heat and this is basically how I answered the question of how gravity works, etc. So in the space mechanics and thermodynamics of the world, as I designed it, gravity and heat kinda exist in the same area.<br>
So, the closer you are to a body that can maintain the gravity to hold you in place, the coldness of the Astral Sea dissapates. So life becomes possible on planets because they are large enough to produce enough heat to push away the cold of The Astra Sea.<br>
For example, the Red Star of Annareth is big enough that it can maintain enough heat that it keeps away the coldness of space. The further you get from these larger objects the colder it gets and eventually you freeze to death; unless you're immune to cold, but in that case you have to deal with the fact you're *in space*.<br>
**Moon (Scrumpo)**: Does our ship count as one of those things large enough to generate heat?<br>
**Arcadum**: That is what makes the vessel so special, because it is not normally big enough, it still can.

Moon brings up Neve's item that allows her to not need to breathe, misunderstanding it as specifically allowing one to breathe in the Astral Sea so Arcadum clarifies on the "air in space" topic:

> **Arcadum**: The thing is, while there is air, it doesn't mean there is always air. It's not like you can breathe everywhere. Just like you can't breathe smoke, you can breathe nebulaic gasses.<br>
Basically, you don't have to worry about "Oh no! We're losing atmospheric pressure in the ship!"

### A Potential Course

Coursety of Disguised in SSC, a plotting of the planets, in order, on the Astral Map:<br>

> Solarity, Loolqua, Ori, Rampart, Maltos

> **Arcadum**: Technically, the closest is Loolqua, followed by Rampart, then Ori, then Solarity, and then obviously Maltos. Also the Twilight Station is probably the closest out of- well Twilight Station is the same distance as Ori.

### Vessel Features

After landing on Rampart Arcadum describes a number of the features of their vessel after Iron Pipe asks Drifter Sai about whether or not they have weapons on the ship that could "support" them if need be.

> **Arcadum**: So, you have 160 power for your ship (total) and everything you do uses power. Power is generated by fuel. Travelling to Rampart cost you 60 fuel. So you are at 100 fuel right now.
>
> To be clear your ship has the following facilities: a healing facility, which is basically just a medbay. It can do lots of advanced stuff, right now it can cast the equivalent of 6th tier healing magic. It can regenerate lost limbs, it cannot, however, revive the dead. Each use, because you do not have the efficiency medbay, from healing a minor cut to repairing a leg is 10 power.<br>
**Bahroo (Iron Pipe)**: What's the ratio of fuel to power?<br>
**Arcadum**: That entirely depends on the fuel.
>
> But other features, you have a gunner on the ship. You do not have air-to-land. You only have air-to-air, not air-to-surface. Each round of combat that you use your weapons costs 5 power.
>
> You have a Scan feature. Each use of scanning takes 10 power. Scanning is like a really jacked up version of primeval awareness that rangers get. It can tell you the demographics of an area, races, creatures in an area. There are some things that defeat scanning such as special materials and areas in which digital magic, which is what you're using, are specifically defeated.
>
> And now the most important facility of your ship that was repaired and that was the Translation facility. Basically, Drifter Sai is able to grant you one language every day. So, when you land on a planet you are able to learn their Common. That takes no power and is a passive feature. However, one caveat, it teaches you how to speak and understand what they're saying but it does not teach you nuance, culture, or slang. It only teaches you the direct meaning of words.
