Party fights the Akai, and saves the village.

Finale special ability:
>**Cross Slash** - As a reaction, you may use 1 strand of life to grant an ally advantaage on their next attack. If that attack hits its target, you may attack, if both attacks hit, your attack is considered a critical hit. If either attack misses you may not use this ability for 2 rounds.

After the fight Pipe inspects the cybernetic warriors. They seem to be following the metal path, much like yourself, though their appearance seems more sinister and less functional. Some changes are purely detrimental and offer no benefit to the replacement of the flesh. In addition to that, the technology they are using, the construct material, matches your own, but there is something else. The more you look the more you uncover, these beings are the same, exactly the same. Like they are produced from a mold.


They have blood. Guy will take a sip. As you taste the blood it has a synthetic metallic taste to it, tastes almost fake. You suppose you could drink it in a desperate situation, but there's no heart in it, so to speak.


Pipe will dismantle the dead for parts.

Scrumpo will find a flower with orange petals on one of the cybernetic warrior's corpses. It almost feels like it was made of glass, with a soft malleable hardness to it. You sense that the flower is rare, its pristine quality having made it through the trek, perhaps it can be a clue from where it came from.

The party will head into town, rest and get Loud Iron upgraded, then head out to deal with the source of the Akai. While in town they are notified of the Akuma guarding the hot springs, but due to the time that would take they opt not to deal with it.

>**Loud Iron**: Accents added to the blade, shaft now has a beautiful design of running stallions through a field. 

Chikanari informs the party that one of the larger clans on Rampart, Okai, are holding the Prefect of Oza's family captive in order force Oza to work with them. Party informs Chikanari that they've supplied the Prefect with a large quantity of emeralds that should alleviate any any monetary issues that they might have as a result of these circumstance.


Ikkar casts Animate Dead on the piles of corpses left behind by the battle, and the session ends. Animate Dead works differently on Rampart.
