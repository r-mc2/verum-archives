## Relevant Lore

### Crestfall Arrival

The party finally arrives at Crestfall. They run into a small bit of trouble with the guards at the front gate, but nothing to really raise any eyes. Flamewrath has Raber put up some posters of the Unwise Six near the gatehouse.

After getting through the checkpoint Vim asks Flamewrath for some coin to go buy some better armor. Nidhogg questions Flamewrath so easily just handing out money and insists on getting a thousand for himself. He's about to do so when Angorn reminds him of where they even acquired the money prompting Flamewrath to start sassing Nidhogg on how he was cowering in the wagon while they acosted the Tortles.

Nidhogg, having none of this, picks Flamewrath up by his collar in plain view of the guards and reminds him he doesn't appreciate his tone. Feeling it not the right place for this conversation the rest of the party encourages Nidhogg to put him down and save it for later. Nidhogg proceeds to just drop him as ungently as possible to the cobblestone below. Fuming at his treatment Flamewrath goes to Angorn and asks him if he'd have any ideas where they could find some homeless he can "vent" on. Angorn recommends the docks and the party splits up. Angorn, Flamewrath, and Raber head to the docks to find some unwitting poor souls. Vim, cash in hand, heads to a blacksmith. Wisp walks around town a bit to do some soul searching. And finally Nidhogg heads off alone to see if he can do anything about his evil-soul-consuming-aura.

### Poor Souls

The trio find themselves in the dock district of Crestfall and proceed to hunt down a number of homeless people mostly through trickery and promises of kindness they'll not find. Setting up shop in an abandonded warehouse Flamewrath brings in the first victim and Firebolts him in the face. Unbeknownst to the party, this warehouse is actually full of barrels of flamable oils and other such substances. Fortunately, luck is on their side and the man in his death throws does not fly into one and... well, end them.

Enamored with the prospect of learning more about his potential abilities, Flamewrath starts to play with the dead man's blood hoping to understand what it is he can do. It's a start, but not quite enough to really grasp what the ability is or how it works. Not satisfied with marginal progress the trio send Raber out to get another "homeless". Through sheer stupidity Raber manages to convince another man to come to the warehouse to help with what he assumed would be some manual labor.

He would be wrong.

This one, unfortunately, they spend a little more time on before Raber eventually bashes his head in. More blood-play, a little more information, but still not enough.

They continue at this for at least one or two more homeless, there's some close calls with the city guard, Raber mistakenly moves a barrel and sets it off/aflame after taking Flamewrath literally about "just move some barrels around." Angorn and Raber run outside just as the barrel bursts setting Raber completly aflame and finally ruining "Rebario" and the outfit.

### Wisp & The Gregorian

Finding herself eventually at a temple to The Seven, Wisp meets a most curious character outside on the steps who seems to be juggling multiple holy symbols of various gods.

Some discussion later, a revelation about Wisp's backstory as a former noble from Dalton, and she learns this man is what is known as a Gregorian Rogue. He follows many gods and "as a suit, wears the one that suits [him] for the day." She finds the prospect very interesting and asks more how she might follow a similar path.

Arcadum reveals it is actually an entire class unto itself and Devin could multi-class or swap classes entirely to Gregorian Rogue. The benefit of the class is that it eventually provides the ability to use Channel Divinity of any religion (although the rogue Wisp met did seem to hint at Babylon being a no-no).

### Vim & The Tortle Blacksmith

Not a lot to say, Vim gets some half-plate, insists the price is too low and therefore not feature-filled enough, but manages to make it sound like he's insulting the craftsmanship of the smith. Vim, still feeling guilt over the two traveling merchant Tortles, attempts to show some kindness to this smith and it all goes wrong. Some further awkward conversation later and Vim ends up paying 500 gold for the 250gp set of armor. Although, he does manage to get a request for a spider insignia/logo to be added to it.

### Nidhogg Seeks Aid

Upon entering what he suspected to be just a bar, he finds out quickly that it is also part brothel and gets into a very interesting conversation with the proprietor, Prescious-Snow-Lei. A number of misjudged vague requests later she finally calls over a wizard of some sort to talk to Nidhogg with his desire to mask his evil-soul-eating aura:

> **Snow-Lei**: Svelt, this man be lookin for ya.<br>
> **Svelt**: Huh? What?! Who?! This man?! He's not a man!<br>
(to Nidhogg) Hello!<br>
**Nidhogg**: I'm not a man?<br>
**Svelt**: How can I help you? I am Svelt, the Incredibly Powerful and Weirdly Specific!<br>
**Nidhogg**: Weirdly specific?<br>
**Svelt**: Yes!<br>
**Nidhogg**: In what aspect?<br>
**Svelt**: Yes!<br>
**Nidhogg**: Aspect of "yes", I understand.<br>
**Svelt**: Yes...<br>
**Nidhogg**: So what is it this man does?<br>
**Snow-Lei**: Uh, he's a mage. I'm sure he could answer your questions.<br>
**Svelt**: Yes! I could answer your questions about your hemorrhoids!<br>

> **Surefour (Nidhogg)**: Can I discern whether he's insane or not?<br>
**Svelt**: (answering Surefour) Yes! I am insane!<br>
**Surefour (Nidhogg)**: I said that out of character! He can read through to-<br>
**Svelt**: Yo~ou thought it! You mind is like an open book to- Oh, my god, you're so full of angst! ...and sadness.<br>

(Yes, Svelt answered in-character to Surefour's out-of-character question.)

> **Nidhogg**: What is happening?<br>
***Svelt** makes a strange gasp-like sound.<br>
**Nidhogg**: Uh... yes?<br>
**Svelt**: Come to this dark seclued corner where we may be edgy and speak!<br>
**Nidhogg**: Uh- oh, okay.<br>
**Svelt**: Hurry along now!<br>

They move to a table in the back corner of the bar.

> **Nidhogg**: Across or beside?<br>
**Svelt**: You may si- Ooo, actually you may sit next to me, we'll be buddies.<br>
Be sure to unsnap from the grid! Good! Now-<br>
**Nidhogg**: I know, I'm quite experienced.<br>
**Svelt**: -tell me, why do you seek Svelt?<br>
***Svelt** turns almost upside down and gets uncomfortably close to Nidhogg.<br>
**Svelt**: Tell him. I-<br>
**Nidhogg**: Svelt? Well, you just read my mind, and you can-<br>
**Svelt**: But you have to say it or it doesn't count!<br>
**Nidhogg**: I- wa- want to hide my aura.<br>
**Svelt**: Why do you want to hide your aura? Be specific!<br>
**Nidhogg**: Because there a lot of holy guards that do not like when they look at me.<br>
***Svelt** somehow manages to get even closer (underlapping Nidhogg's token with his eye still visible)<br>
**Svelt**: Oh, why is that? Why to they- Why...<br>
**Nidhogg**: Do you not know?<br>
**Svelt**: You have to say it or it doesn't count.<br>
**Nidhogg**: What doesn't count? Why do you keep saying this?<br>
**Svelt**: Just say it! What do you want?! For what for?! What have you done?! TELL ME YOUR SECRETS!<br>
**Nidhogg**: Can you stop *screaming*?<br>
**Svelt**: Oh, sorry, I did not mean to be rude. We shall ins-<br>
**Nidhogg**: We're trying to be private and you're screaming in a crowded area.<br>
**Svelt**: Oh you're right. In that case we will go (\**whispers*\*) to the shadows. Yes, good, we are now whispering. Now, spill your secrets.<br>
***Svelt** backs up into his own seat.<br>
**Nidhogg**: (also whispering) How do I know I can even trust you?<br>
**Svelt**: Because, I am insane!<br>
**Nidhogg**: ...uh- So- One thing lead to another and I have absorbed a soul.<br>
**Svelt**: Oooh, you're a soul eater. Well, that sure is *ALARMING*. Very well, fear not I shall assist you, because I... *need* to.<br>
**Nidhogg**: Wai- What? You need to?<br>
**Svelt**: Of course, I have been *INFORMED* that I must.<br>
**Nidhogg**: Can I ask from who?<br>
**Svelt**: Oh, I think you know my friend, for we all walk a similar path.<br>
***Svelt** lets out a maddened half-laugh, half-squeal.<br>
**Nidhogg**: I assume this is where the insanity comes from?<br>
**Svelt**: Of course! Where do you think my power comes from?<br>
**Nidhogg**: I understand-<br>
**Svelt**: But, first, you must listen carefully. Yes, listen. Listen with your echoing ears of my voice going in and massaging your mind.<br>
**Nidhogg**: I hope they're not massaging, but I-<br>
**Svelt**: Oh, my hands with my mind are very masseuse-ily.<br>
**Nidhogg**: Alright...<br>
**Svelt**: Shut up! Open your mouth!<br>
***Svelt** moves in closer to Nidhogg.<br>
**Nidhogg**: My mouth?!<br>
**Svelt**: Do it!<br>
***Nidhogg** opens his mouth.<br>
**Svelt**: Wider!<br>
***Nidhogg** opens wider.<br>
**Svelt**: Accept my blessing!<br>
***Svelt** puts his hand into Nidhogg's mouth.<br>
**Svelt**: Yes! Feel the power!<br>
**Arcadum**: He will cast non-detection on you ðŸ™‚.<br>
He will pull his hand free of your mouth. His hand is missing. He will look at it.<br>
**Svelt**: Shit! I left it inside! Eh, it's fine.<br>
**Nidhogg**: Is that normal??<br>
**Svelt**: Ye~es...<br>
**Nidhogg**: Then why were you surprised?<br>
**Svelt**: Yes.<br>
**Nidhogg**: Ah yes, the aspect of "yes". I remember now.<br>
**Svelt**: One moment, I must regenerate my hand.<br>
***Svelt** makes a couple popping sounds.<br>
**Svelt**: Better! Now, listen carefully to me. This powerful enchantment will only last for seventeen hours ...and 32 minutes.<br>
**Nidhogg**: Is there any way to refresh it?<br>
**Svelt**: Yes!<br>
**Nidhogg**: Lemme guess, come back to you?<br>
**Svelt**: Yes!<br>
**Nidhogg**: Is there anything you can tell me about soul eating?<br>
**Svelt**: Yes.<br>
**Nidhogg**: What can you tell me?<br>
**Svelt**: Come a little closer. A little bit closer. Just a bit closer.<br>
***Svelt** edges right back up uncomfortably close to Nidhogg (under his token again, eyes just visible)<br>
**Nidhogg**: Well, you're coming to me...<br>
**Svelt**: Now, listen to me. To consume a soul is to perform great evil.<br>
**Nidhogg**: I'm aware of that.<br>
**Svelt**: But, there is a way to find souls for consumption. You must need a vessel to call forth the soul, an item of forbidden naughtiness.<br>
**Nidhogg**: And where do I get it?<br>
**Svelt**: Ironically, there is such an item here within the Holy City. For you see, soul-mancy is not the domain of only the evil gods but the holy ones as well.<br>
**Nidhogg**: And where is it kept?<br>
**Svelt**: Seek thee the temple of Glory. Deep within its catacombs it is rumored that one of their priests, Azatar the Holy, wielded a smokey censor that could pull forth damned souls and release them from their torment.<br>
**Nidhogg**: And are they just bythemself in the catacombs? Is this- dangerous place? I'd assume so.<br>
**Svelt**: I mean, it's a catacombs. What do yo- What? What?<br>
**Nidhogg**: Listen, you never know. There's a bunch of weird people.<br>
**Svelt**: You know what? You're right! Fuck the paladins! Fuck everyone! I will literally *HAVE SEX WITH THEM*!<br>
**Nidhogg**: Alright, whatever you're into, man.<br>
**Svelt**: Now, seek the Azolon the Holy, his tomb beneath the holy temple of Glory. There you will find the item you seek. Now, do not disturb me as I must go under the table and discuss with my partner...<br>
***Svelt** disappears under the table.<br>
**Nidhogg**: Uhh, just to be sure, was it Azatar or Azolon?<br>
***Nidhogg** checks under the table.<br>
**Arcadum**: He's gone.<br>
**Nidhogg**: Weeell then...<br>
**Svelt**: (faintly echoing from somewhere) It was Azatar~~...<br>
**Nidhogg**: Thank you... That must be the hand in my stomach.<br>
**Svelt's Hand**: Yes.<br>
**Nidhogg**: Oh, god, you're with me all the time now?<br>
**Svelt's Hand**: Always.<br>
**Nidhogg**: I feel like this was intentional.<br>
**Svelt's Hand**: ...until I am digested.<br>
**Nidhogg**: Oh.<br>
**Svelt's Hand**: Ooo, I could scratch your stomach!<br>
***Svelt's Hand** scritches lightly.

> **Surefour (Nidhogg)**: Hmm, should I go to a temple of Glory by myself, right now...?<br>
> **Arcadum** Meanwhile! Back at the docks!
