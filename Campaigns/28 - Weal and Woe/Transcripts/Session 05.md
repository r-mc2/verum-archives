## Relevant Lore

Having finished the battle last session, the party returns to the tavern. Luun informs them that the tower has been unlocked. As they enter the tavern Anna is floating off the ground and mana is leaking out of her. The party contacts Taladon to get more information and the connection is slightly interfered with because of Anna. Taladon informs that he senses the key.

### First Floor

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ckdZnUQ.jpg" alt="The First Floor" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/ckdZnUQ.jpg)

> **Luun**: This place is strange. It seems old. Older than I have seen. I can see the marking of the Taladoni everywhere.

As the the party investigates the tower each of the crates and barrels contain arcane paraphernalia. Ornate salts, ingredients for spell-casting, potion creation, magical inscription, and very useful stuff for anyone who would use it. It is a huge stockpile.

Then Laius finds out something. Luun states this is a Taladoni tower but this is one thing he notices. In the center of the room, there is a sort of large stone structure that could almost be a fountain except inside there are inscriptions that are not as old as the tower. They are written in modern day common. What is etched within this fountain or whatever this is: `"Do not open the star."`

> **Luun**: This inscription is troubling. Raven's Watch has only been inhabited by us for only a decade or so. It has stood longer than we've came. It is possible that someone opened the way.

### Second Floor

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YfzRYdx.jpg" alt="The Second Floor" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/YfzRYdx.jpg)

An ancient armory, dust covers each of the old blades. Several of these blades are of masterwork quality and there are some equipment behind a glass display case.

Lily breaks the glass of the display case due to it being locked. Shards of sharp glass go over him and Laius. The following items are revealed: A shining mithril breastplate, a longsword, a set of bracers, and a pair of boots. Further arcana checks reveal that all of these items are magical.


| Item | Description |
|--|--|
| **Sliverguard Breastplate** | +1 Mithril Breastplate. Healing received increased by +3 |
| **Silverguard Blade** | +1 Silver Longsword. Deals an additional [d6] sliver fire damage. |
| **Bracers of the Silver Mage** | Grant constant Mage Armor effect. |
| **Boots of the Silver Guard** | Grant an additional 10 land movement speed. |

Checking the rest of the floor they find inside the black chests stocks of steel, iron, and a few stocks of mithril. The party grabs a few additional masterwork items and goes to the next floor.

### Third Floor

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nE8sF8u.jpg" alt="The Third Floor" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/nE8sF8u.jpg)

This room is filled to the brim with all sorts of cartography. There are maps, notes, listings of what appears to be countries, and markings all in the Taladoni language. In the center of the room, there is a map; in the center of that map is the continent of Kalkatesh. As far as they know in their common knowledge, Kalkatesh is the only land there is. They have heard there are other places in the ocean, but nobody has met anybody from there and just mythology and rumors at best. But this map, this shows much more. It shows seven continents.

> **Mara**: Are there any distinguishing points, mana points, or places of power to the nearest continents?<br>
**Arcadum**: The closest continent is a much larger continent than Kalkatesh. As she concentrates on it the map suddenly shifts and reacts to Mara's will. The map zooms in and the map seems to show different pieces of the continent and separations. All written in Taladonic, but the word Glies is shown.

The other tables seem to have measurements. If the central map is the magical representation of where that is, the other tables are measurements on how to get that information. The different times, the crossing points, and etc. 

Mara transcribes the maps on the central table and the party advances to the next floor.

### Fourth Floor

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0M0uBkV.jpg" alt="The Forth Floor" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/0M0uBkV.jpg)

The floor enters into a mess hall. As they search this area, this is most certainly a mess hall. There are tables, chairs, and bars there to eat. There is no food. However, Meni sees a machine. There are different knobs and levers. Some sort of automatic kitchen. As Meni takes a closer look at the kitchen and understands what it means. This represent water, the temperature of the water, flour, and so on and so forth. She uses the machine and makes finger cakes. As a magical whirring is heard, the cakes appear throughout all the tables. 

Laius picks up the finger cake, takes a bite, and it is creamy, sweet, hanging, and delicious. As Laius eats it, he heals for 10 hit points.

### Fifth Floor

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tRrWueP.jpg" alt="Fifth Floor with Statues" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/tRrWueP.jpg)

As they enter this floor, they can see an array of different statues of different styles and materials arranged haphazardly in this room. In the center, there is a statue of a man chained to the floor eminating out mana that is visible to the naked eye. It seeps out into the ceiling.

The group tries an arcana check to learn more.

(Barbie arcana: `18(18)`)

> **Arcadum**: Alright, Barbie, as you take a closer look at all the statues, you begins to notice something. While they appear to be made out of different styles or different materials and they seem somewhat unconnected, you're able to determine some things. They appear to be set in a very specific order. As you begin walking at the display, from a certain angle begin to see why it was placed in such a way. The statues tell a story. A story of a people. It seems the story starts [in the north-west of the room]. You don't know what the people it is represents, but this is what the story tells you:
>
> A people with great magical power and knowledge... [1]
>
> ...light the way for others lost within the great night. [2]
>
> They protect others from dark things that move just outside of sight. [3]
>
> Through this power they became mighty. Striking down even the most powerful beings of the darkness. [4]
>
> Until, finally, their dominion allowed them to grow complacent, luxurious, and opulent. [5]
>
> And it was in this moment when great sovereignty and power was at their height... [6]
>
> ...that they began to hunger for more. [7]
>
> So, seeking even more power, these people turned towards a terrible source. [8]
>
> And though it seemed that they had plenty. Power. Prestige. [9]
>
> They were not but prisoners within their own strength. Until finally, their downfall. [10]
>
> For at the base of this [center] statue is a plaque: The Folly of Maltos.

A guide to the order the the statues were "toured" in. Numbers on the statues match the number at the end of the line above in brackets (e.g. first statue is [1]):

Condensed version of the story (for copy/pasting ðŸ˜‰):

> A people with great magical power and knowledge light the way for others lost within the great night.<br>
They protect others from dark things that move just outside of sight.<br>
Through this power they became mighty. Striking down even the most powerful beings of the darkness.<br>
Until, finally, their dominion allowed them to grow complacent, luxurious, and opulent.<br>
And it was in this moment when great sovereignty and power was at their height that they began to hunger for more.<br>
So, seeking even more power, these people turned towards a terrible source.<br>
And though it seemed that they had plenty. Power. Prestige.<br>
They were not but prisoners within their own strength. Until finally, their downfall.<br>
For at the base of this [center] statue is a plaque: The Folly of Maltos.

### Sixth Floor

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eULbHr0.png" alt="The Sixth Floor" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/eULbHr0.png)

They see a floor of a strange contraption of cogs and gear. Mana is in the center with a condensed concentration. They are able to figure out on how to activate it. There is an area in the center in which mana can be placed by the way mana is moving in and out of it. The many cogs and twisting wheels seem to be dormant now, but would be able to moved with the purpose they have served with the power provided.

The party asks Luun to take a look at it for them after everyone fails an arcana check:

> **Luun**: This port requires an exorbitant amount of mana. Also, it seems there is an handprint in this indention.<br>
**Mara**: Is this the throne that Taladon was talking about?<br>
**Luun**: I don't know. It does not look like a throne. However, a throne can be a metaphorical symbol of authority.

Barbie places his hand into where the mana concentrates. As he does so, mana drains from Barbie at a rapid and accelerated pace. Due to his quick dexterity, he suddenly pulls it free and after he pulls it free everybody sees Barbie's skin becomes ragged as if he has aged. In fact, it almost looks like his youth is nearly spent, but slowly his age fades back into him. While Barbie had his hand placed in the concentrated spot, the machine moved slightly then stopped.

### Seventh Floor

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1zhB8e4.png" alt="The Seventh Floor" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/1zhB8e4.png)

Above them, there is a great glass ceiling and a large device in the center. One of them learned enough to know it to be a telescope. Around them are lights twinkling and magic swirling all around the telescope. They see that in front of the telescope is a chair.

They attempt to contact Taladon again and are unable to make a connection. Mara believes that the chair, the telescope, and the machine below are all connected somehow. She eventually encourages Anna to sit on the chair, however, nothing seem to happen.

### Powering The Tower

Laius makes a perception check while at the telescope. As he takes a seat, he notices there is a light that is shining off his new silver gauntlet. The light appears to be coming from the eyepiece of the telescope and appears to be a violet light.

Being wary of what Taladon mentioned to them previously about that color they ask if Luun could look through the telescope for them. Luun will sit on the chair and look through the eyepiece of the telescope. As he does so, something begins to happen. He begins to shake uncontrollably then violet cracks begin to appear along the construct. His hood burns in violet fire. Slowly the construct will turn to look at Laius, its body contorting and shifting into ash. and then Luun will say:

> **Luun**: "Run!"

He will turn to ash. A violet ash pile will be all that remains of Luun. Lily and Laius return back to the sixth floor and rejoin the rest of the party to inform them of what happened with a twist. Lily is able to convince them Luun's final words were to put Anna's hand into the mana receptical.

As Anna places her hand into the contraption it begins to drain her of mana. However, she has a pool of excess strength. The gears begins to hum of life and it doesn't seem to negatively effect Anna in any way. The mana begins to swirl and brighten, the gears begin to turn until finally they begin to whirl at an even pace. The seal loses its light and Anna pulls her hand away, saying "Doesn't need more."

The contraption begins to activate. The wheels turn and shift and above the lights around the telescope begin to shift and move. With Lily back up on the seventh floor he will see that the star map begins to move in a counter-clockwise fashion until it stops. Eventually after some checks are made and the party regroups together with Lily, Mara begins to study the strange swirling magic in front of her. 

Congratulations, you have awoken the tower. The pulsing throne has now been activated an the Anathema has been placed in her proper place. This entire tower is meant to power this telescope and to use the exorbitant amount of mana to observe places across the astral sea. Also, it can also drain mana from across the astral sea.

Barbie looks into the telescope.

### Through A Telescope Darkly

As Barbie looks through the telescope he sees the Astral Sea, the nebula Verum is in specifically. However, because the telescope is fully powered by the Anathema, it is able to zoom out and reveal several swirling nebulas filled with several other planes of existence surrounding the initial one. As it turns out the telescope was looking at The Herald.  However, the adjustments of the telescope have moved it slightly away from The Herald. Currently it is focused within the nebula. In just the distance is a twinge of violet light.

Barbie moves the telescope to Maltos. This one is unlike Kalkatesh or anything that he has seen. It is comprised entirely of metal, buildings, impossibly large, float into a centralized structure. The telescope begins to zoom in automatically. The sight is revealed. Until finally, he sees something. The world shifts and floats throughout the astral sea, rotating slightly, then a symbol moves across the front of the world. And there, there is an enormous symbol of a seven-pointed star. As the telescope looks at it, it begins to light, and the star begins to glow all the way across the Astral Sea. The contraption activates. A lever jettisons out from the nearby clockwork directly in front of Barbie. It would seem that the star is waiting to be opened.

The party seeks the advice of Taladon to see if they should pull the lever. 

> **Taladon**: Do not. Do not open the star. If you have placed the Anathema upon the throne-

Mara recaps for Taladon what they did and questions the hand-recepticle as the throne:

> **Taladon**: That is the throne. The throne is not a seat. It is the center of power on which you stand.

What should they do, the party asks:

> **Taladon**: All in good time, but I must return to the waking realm. Turn the gaze of the device towards me. Open your mind, I shall move the controls. 

Taladon begins to take control of Barbie and controls the telescope to his location. It rests on a curious satellite drifting through the Astral Sea. There they see it focus. They see something strange about it. It appears to be a small island covered with trees and a beach and even water around it. What's strange about it is that the sand is black and everything that should be green is instead white. They also see small buildings within the center and then, underneath the island, the telescope focuses its power and begins to drain mana from underneath. Until finally, something breaks free. Thus, Barbie regains control of his body once more as Taladon manifests before them.

### The Return of Taladon

> **Taladon**: It would seem that I have returned to the waking realm. Death, it would seem, has not stopped me. I thank you for your service, but now our work can be begin. It is time. We have much to discuss.

Taladon will begin to explain to what the rest of the campaign will be about. As Taladon as returned, Taladon has the ability to revive the Taladonic structures that litter The Rift. In doing so, one piece at a time, he is able to stabilize The Rift and use the ancient magic against The Herald. As they have restored Taladon to the waking realm, the world gains 10 Order. 

> **Taladon**: There are many structures that require revival. There are many things that need to be done, but before we may begin: we will need to survive. Supplies of mana. Supplies of true assistance. We will need to build a base of operations here within this village. What is this village?<br>
**The Party**: Raven's Watch<br>
**Taladon**: We will use this place to consolidate our power and to go throughout The Rift. I must not show my power to them as I'm afraid it will frighten them. I will need you to be my hands and face. 

The party agrees, albeit with a bit of trepidation given his form of arriving in front of them in the Waking Realm.

> **Taladon**: Very well, the first structure I need you to revive is where we will construct a proper base of operations. There is an old constructor unit that still exists nearby, but it will need to be cleared of its malfeasance, the infectious vermin forces that seem to have taken advantage of its heat source. Once that you have done so, place this within its eye.<br>
***Taladon** gives them a small piece of marble with a Taladonic rune on it.<br>
**Taladon**: Place that in its eye and it will return to us and build what we require. Furthermore, now that I have returned to the waking realm, it is time you are given the strength you need to complete these tasks. 

He will clap his hands together and they are now the next level.
