After the battle, the party returns to the tavern. Luun informs them that the tower has been unlocked. As they enter the tavern, Anna is floating off the ground and mana is leaking out of her. The party contacts Taladon to get more information and the connection is slightly interfered with because of Anna. Taladon informs that he senses the key.

Floor 1

> **Luun**: This place is strange. It seems old. Older than I have seen. I can see the marking of the Taladoni everywhere.

As the the party investigates the tower, each of the crates and barrels contain arcane paraphernalia. Ornate salts, ingredients for spell-casting, potion creation, magical inscription, and very useful stuff for anyone who would use it. It is a huge stockpile.

The Laius finds out something. Luun states this is a Taladoni tower but this is one thing he notices. In the center of the room, there is a sort of large stone structure that could almost be a fountain except inside there are inscriptions that are not as old as the tower. They are written in modern day common. What is etched within this fountain or whatever this is: "Do not open the star."

> **Luun**: This inscription is troubling. Raven's Watch has only been inhabited by us for only a decade or so. It has stood longer than we've came. It is possible that someone opened the way.

Floor 2

An ancient armory, dust covers each of the old blades. Several of these blades are of masterwork quality and there are some equipment behind a glass display case.

Lily breaks the glass of the display case due to it being locked. Shards of sharp glass go over him and Laius. The following items are revealed: A shining mithril breastplate, a longsword, a set of bracers, and a pair of boots.

All of these items are magical.

**Silverguard Breastplate** - +1 Mithril Breastplate | Healing increased by 3.<br>
**Silverguard Blade** - +1 Silver Longsword | This deals an additional [d6] silver fire damage.<br>
**Bracers of the Silver Mage** - These bracers grant a constant amge armor effect.<br>
**Boots of the Silver Guard** - These boots grant an addition 10 land movement speed.<br>

Inside the black chests, stocks of steel, iron, and a few stocks of mithril. The party grabs a few additional masterwork items and goes to the next floor.

Floor 3

This room is filled with the brim of all sorts of cartography. There are maps, notes, listings of what appears to be countries, and markings all in the Taladoni language. In the center of the room, there is a map: in the center of that map is the continent of Kalkatesh. As far as they know in their common knowledge, Kalkatesh is the only land there is. They have heard there are other places in the ocean, but nobody has meant anybody from there and just mythology and rumors than most. This shows much more: it shows seven continents. 

> **Mara**: Are there any distinguishing points, mana points, or places of power to the nearest continents?<br>
**Arcadum**: The closest continent is much larger continent that Kalkatesh. As she concentrates on it, the map suddenly shifts and reacts to Mara's will. The map zooms in and the map seems to show different pieces of the continent and separations. All written in Taladonic, but the word Glies is shown.

The other tables seem to have measurements. If the central map is the magical representation of where that is, the other tables are measurements on how to get that information. The different times, the crossing points, and etc. 

Mara transcribes the maps on the central table and the party advances to the next floor.

Floor 4

The floor enters into a mess hall. As they search this area, this is most certainly a mess hall. There are tables, chairs, and bars there to eat. There is no food. However, Meni sees a machine. There are different knobs and levers. Some sort of automatic kitchen. As Meni takes a closer look at the kitchen and understands what it means. This represent water, the temperature of the water, flour, and so on and so forth. She uses the machine and makes finger cakes. As a magical whirring is hear, the cakes appear throughout all the tables. 

Laius picks up the finger cake, takes a bit, and it is creamy, sweet, hanging, and delicious. As Laius eats it, he heals for 10 hit points.

Floor 5

As they enter this floor, they can see an array of different statues of different styles and materials arranged haphazardly in this room. In the center, there is a statue of a man chained to the floor with mana coming out of his eye. It seeps out into the ceiling. 

As Barbie takes a closer look at the statues, he begins to notice something. As they appear to be made out of different styles and materials, and they seem unconnected: he is able to determine some thing. They appear to be set in a specific order. As he starts on the display at a certain angle, he is able to see why it was placed in such a way. The statues tell a story. A story of a people. It seems the story starts the top left. He does know who the people were. A people of great magical knowledge light the paths of those who are lost in the night. They protect those of in the dark from great sight. They strike the things in the darkness until their dominion allowed them to great complacent and opulent. In this moment, it was great sovereignty and power was at their height that they began to hunger for more. So, seeking even more power, these people turned to a terrible source even though they seemed to have plenty. Power. Prestige. They were not but prisoners within their own strength. Until finally, their downfall. At the base of the center statue is a plague: The Folly of Maltos.

Floor 6

They see a floor of a strange contraption of cogs and gear. Mana is in the center with a condensed concentration. They are able to figure out on how to activate it. There is an area in the center in which mana can be placed by the way mana is moving in and out of it. The many cogs and twisting wheels seem to be dormant now, but would be able to moved with the purpose they have served with the power provided.

> **Luun**: This port requires an exorbitant amount of mana. Also, it seems there is an handprint in this indention.<br>
**Mara**: Is this the throne that Taladon was talking about?<br>
**Luun**: I don't know. It does not look like a throne. However, a throne is a metaphorical symbol of authority.

Barbie places his hand into where the mana concentrates. As he does so, mana drains from Barbie at a rapid and accelerated pace. Due to his quick dexterity, he suddenly pulls it free and everybody that pulls it free: Barbie's skin becomes ragged as he has aged. In fact, it almost looks like his youth is nearly spent, but slowly his age fades back into him. While Barbie had his hand placed in the concentrated spot, the machine moved slightly then stopped.

---

Floor 7

Above them, there is a great glass ceiling and a large device in the center. One of them learned knows it to be a telescope. Around them are lights twinkling and magic swirling all around the telescope. They see that in front of the telescope is a chair.

- They are unable to make a connection to Taladon.
- Mara believes that the chair, the telescope, and the machine below are all connected somehow.
- Anna gets up and sits on the chair and nothing seem to happen.

---

Laius makes a perception check while at the telescope. As he takes a seat, he notices there is a light that is shining off the silver gauntlet. The light appears to be coming from the eyepiece of the telescope and appears to be a violet light.

Luun will sit on the chair and look through the eyepiece of the telescope. As he does so, something begins to happen. He begins to shake uncontrollably then violet cracks begin to appear along the construct. His hood burns in violet fire. Slowly the construct will turn to look at Laius, his body contorting and shifting into ash. and then Luun will say "Run!"

He will turn to Anna and Luun turns into a violet ash pile.

As their reactions, they put Anna's hand into the contraption on the sixth floor. As Anna places her hand into the contraption, he begins to drain her of mana. However, she has a pool of excess strength. It begins to hum of life and doesn't negatively effect Anna in any way. The mana begins to swirl and brighten, the gears begin to turn until finally they begin to whirl at an even pace. The seal loses its light and Anna pulls her hand away, saying "Does it need more?"

The contraption begins to activate. The wheels turn and shift and above the lights around the telescope begin to shift and move. The star map on the seventh floor begins to move in a counter-clockwise fashion until it stops. Mara begins to study the strange swirling magic in front of her. 

Congratulations you have awoken the tower. The pulsing throne has now been activated an the anathema has been placed in her proper place. This entire tower is meant to power this telescope and to use the exorbitant amount of mana to observe places across the astral sea. Also, it can also drain mana from across the astral sea.

Barbie looks into the telescope.

Star Map

As Barbie looks through the telescope, he sees the telescope. He is on Verum, on the continent of Kalkatesh. Around Verum on the various aspects of elements. However, fully powered by the Anathema, he is able to see several swirling nebulas filled with several other planes of existence. Several other planets. The telescope was looking at The Herald.  However, the adjustments of the telescope have moved it slightly away from The Herald. Currently it is focused within the nebula. In just the distance is a twinge of violet light.

Barbie moves the telescope to Maltos. This one is unlike Kalkatesh or anything that he has seen. It is comprised entirely of metal, buildings, impossibly large, float into a centralized structure. The telescope begins to zoom in automatically. The sight is revealed. Until finally, he sees something. The world shifts and floats throughout the astral sea, rotating slightly, then a symbol moves across the front of the world. In there, there is an enormous symbol of a seven-pointed star. As the telescope looks at it, it begins to light and the star begins to glow all the way across the astral sea. The contraption activates. A lever jettisons out from the nearby clockwork directly in front of Barbie. It would seem that the star is waiting to be opened.

The party seeks the advice of Taladon to see if they should pull the lever. 

> **Taladon**: Do not. Do not open the star. If you have placed the Anathema upon the throne. That is the throne. The throne is not a seat. It is the center of power on which you stand. All in good time, but I must return to the waking realm. Turn the gaze of the device towards me. Open your mind, I shall move the controls. 

Taladon begins to take control of Barbie and controls the telescope to his location. It rests on a curious satellite throughout the astral sea. There, they see it focus. They see something strange about it. It appears to be a small island covered with trees and a beach and even water around it. What's strange about it is that the sand is black and everything that should be green is instead white. They also see small buildings within the center and then, underneath the island, the telescope focuses its power and begins to drain mana from underneath. Until finally, something breaks free. Thus,  Barbie regains control of his body once more as Taladon manifests before them.

> **Taladon**: It would seem that I have returned to the waking realm. Death, it would seem, has not stopped me. I thank you for your service, but now our work can be begin. It is time. We have much to discuss.

Taladon will begin to explain to what the rest of the campaign will be about. As Taladon as returned, Taladon has the ability to revive the Taladonic structure that litter the rift. As doing so, one piece at a time, he is able to stabilize The Rift and use the ancient magic against the Herald. As they have restored Taladon to the waking realm, the world gains 10 Order. 

There are many structures that require revival. There are many things that need to be done, but before we may begin: we will need survive. Supplies of mana. Supplies of true assistance. We will need to build a base of operations here within this village. What is this village?

> **The Party**: Raven's Watch<br>
**Taladon**: We will use this place to consolidate our power and to go throughout the rift. I must not show my power to them as I'm afraid it will frighten them. I will need you to be my hands. 

> **Taladon**: Very well, the first structure I need you to revive is where we will construct a proper base of operations. There is an old constructor unit that still exists nearby, but it will need to be cleared of its malfeasance the infectious vermin forces that seem to have taken advantage of its heat source. Once that you have done so, place this within its eye.

He gives them a small piece of marble with a Taladonic rune on it.

> **Taladon**: Place that in its eye and it will return to us, and build what we require. Furthermore, now that I have returned to the waking realm, it is time you are given the strength you need to complete these tasks. 

He will clap his hands together and they are now the next level.
