## Relevant Lore

> **Arcadum** Aleo will smile, he will dance on his feet, he looks ready to get in there. However, in all his bravado and his willingness to prove himself, he is suddenly struck by something that no one can see. He grasps at his heart, as his ring shatters and falls to the ground. He stares for a long moment, his bravado gone, his willfulness, his strength, stolen from him. Where there was once happiness and service, there is now only despair. Alleo Ad’Daire loses two Armor Class.<br>
No tears, no words. Alleo picks up his ring, the crystals begin to grow around him<br>
**Aleo**: Guess I’m done, then.<br>
***Aleo** slowly sinks down inside of the crystals.<br>
**Arcadum**: However.

Lumina begins to play.

> **Arcadum**: As Alleo sinks into the Indigo Scar, possessing no will to fight, and finally, simply wishing to seek oblivion, to escape the tearing at his heart. A hand reaches beyond reality’s folds, and for just a brief moment, the world stops. The spectral hand of a maiden in white reaches down, and grabs at Alleo's coat, and pulls him free of the crystals. You know not whom this maiden is, but you notice that she thrums with the power of the Seven. She embraces him from behind, and the crystals begin to shatter.<br>
**Aleo**: “My sweetness, I thought you were-“<br>
***Woman** places a finger upon his mouth, and shakes her head, and turns to face him toward you. He will nod, power surging through his body.<br>
**Aleo**: Fine. Torchbearers, my love's faded from this world, and the responsibility she bore now weighs upon your shoulders. We may not have ever met, but there is a kinship between us, and as such, if you are to bear the burden that my wife once did, then I will make sure that you are worthy of it! Cause no one is worthy of her, least of all me. Draw your weapons, and send me home. Please.<br>
I hope not to fail you, Minthis. I hope… I hope to earn my spot with you and your comrades, I know I was never… equal to you. I couldn’t even save you in the end.
***Minthis** will not hear any of that nonsense, and will stand behind him, shining with a white light. And then it happens, the ring repairs and places itself back upon his finger where it belongs.<br>
**Arcadum**: She may be dead, faded from this world. But the hope that she lended to this world is not.<br>
***Aleo**’s eyes shine slightly with a soft Violet shade.<br>
**Aleo**: So be it my love, I will test these Torchbearers. That’s enough crying. Let’s get to it then.

### Morgeta's Mechanics Document

Morgeta made a rather detailed document on Aleo as an enemy. Mechanics, initatives, etc. You can read up on it in the [Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1240xhdpyAmvuvs9kkPRZ7KsG9wVDhcZy1sseIIA0nQ4).
