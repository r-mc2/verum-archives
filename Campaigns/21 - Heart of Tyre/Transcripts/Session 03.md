# Heart of Tyre -- Session 03

## Relevant Lore

Having been cornered by the surgeons in the hallway last session and the potential threat of a Flesh Crime behind them, the party begins their first real fight inside their wing of the Labyrinth against Tyre's creations, the Flesh Crimes.

### Flesh Crime Omega

As the fight progresses against the enemies in the hallways of this "hospital" the party attempts to run-n-gun while heading west to get away from all the enemies closing in on them. However, the closer they get to the end of the hallway some perceptions checks are made and it would appear Flesh Crime Omega is actually approaching from the west.

Understandably, the party begins to work their way back to the east, through the existing enemies. Some concern over whether or not it really is the Omega they have a brief discussion about the logs from the previous episode and that it was mentioned that Omega was "sealed", however, that was only what the logs stated and who knows how outdated they may be.

After a round or two more of combat the enemies continue to head towards the party and unexpectedly stop in place. One of the Agonizing Experiments then seems to book it down the hallway towards the west, past the party,whilst making no attacks nor giving any concern for opportunity attacks. This confuses the party greatly, Scott makes a check on those movements.

(Antonious Insight: `16(16)`)

> **Arcadum**: It seems that the creature is not moving of its own accord.

The Corrupted Supplicants move to attack, raising up their tentacles, then stop and begin moving strangely westward as well. Then, with no warning they all fall to the ground, dead.

> **Arcadum**: And now it is *something* else's turn.<br>
And you finally look towards the west and you see this creature:

> **Arcadum**: As the creature rounds the corner the psionic energy begins to overwhelm all of you and you find yourselves unable to move, but the creature moves forward. A deep, insidious dread falls over you, but the creature moves in a non-hostile gate.<br>
**Flesh Crime Omega**: (unintelligible Druidic speech, occasionally you can make out the word "Crowley")<br>
***Flesh Crime Omega** moves towards the party, flinging the Agonizing Experiment into the wall, killing it. It continues to move, "gently" moving the party up to the north wall and out of its way while continuing to mutter Druidic. It eventually makes its way down the south hallway and out of sight.<br>
**Arcadum**: What do you do?<br>
**Scott (Antonious)**: Antonious put his finger to his mouth signaling "quiet", and point to the east, and see what the rest of the party wants to do.<br>
**Arcadum**: Now, remember the DM did tell you it was optional.<br>
**Scott (Antonious)**: Yes. Yes he did.<br>

> **Antonious**: I want to go to the room of safety. I'm scared.

> **Summer (Seren)**: I'd like to cast Pass Without Trace so we can go back to the safe room.<br>
**Naomi (Neve)**: Was he speaking Wicked?<br>
**Arcadum**: *He* was speaking Druidic. Would you like to know what he was saying?<br>
**Summer (Seren)**: I would *love* to know what he was saying.<br>
**Arcadum**: Alright, make me three wisdom saving throws!<br>
**Snake (Ives)**: Oh boy...<br>

(Seren Wisdom Saves: `19(11)`, `16(8)`, & `27(19)`)

> **Arcadum**: Those are all sufficient, you do not gain an insanity. Seren:

> **Flesh Crime Omega**: Evolve. Zeezus. Evolve. Crowley. It calls. Azengolt. It calls. Beyond. Wriggling. Writhing. Given. Taken. Zeezus. Evolve. See. See. See. See. See. SEE. *SEE!* *SEE!* ***SEE!*** ***SEE!*** ***SEEEEEE-***

> **Arcadum**: Seren gains psionic latency.<br>
**Summer (Seren)**: WHAT THE FUCK?! What does that do?<br>
**Arcadum**: You now have access to psionic powers. And we're gonna talk about that when its time to, but for now only mark down that you have latent psionic ability awakened by your knowledge of the nature of the world by the forbidden strength of the Overmind yet unrealized.
