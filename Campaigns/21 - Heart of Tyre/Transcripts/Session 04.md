# Heart of Tyre -- Session 04

Aired: 08/03/2020

## Relevant Lore

After the events of last session the group heads back out towards the front desk and Ives uses the return crystal to go back to camp. Except, it seems to fizzle out.

### A Failed Exit

Seren unexpectedly passes out as the party is trying to leave the labyrinth:

> **Arcadum**: Seren, you fall to the ground in terrible pain, clutching at head as it pounds with the strongest headache you've ever had in your entire life.
>
> As you fall to the ground there are pulses.

Arcadum proceeds to show very specific and zoomed in portions of the first floor of their wing of the Labyrinth. These are only visible to Seren, like a vision.

A creature of some sort can be heard screeching in the final two.

Seren falls unconscious and the party checks on Seren and tries to figure out what's wrong with her. Her pulse is weak, but rapid as if terribly afraid. She has also broken out in what seems like a cold sweat across her body. They try to connect the timing of her collapsing with Ives activating the crystal, but aren't sure.

Ives begins to rifle through Seren's belongings looking for the herbs the found previously, specifically the Silver one -- Mental Acuity. He combines the silver with a white herb (purity) in a mortar and pestle and gives the combination to Seren.

(This pleases the Arcadoodles)

> **Arcadum**: Seren begins to salivate from her mouth, foaming. She begins to have a siezure. Her body twitches, her eyes open, and you see that the goat-like pupils that she once had become wriggly and tentacle-like. The shift into a spiral. And Summer, you and I get to have a "friendly" conversation.

### The Brass King Speaks

And then, unbenownst to the rest of the party, something reaches out and speaks into her mind:

> **Brass King**: Such an interesting thought to enter this place. State your name, little thought. I wish to know thee.<br>
**Seren**: Uh, it's uh, Seren.<br>
**Brass King**: SEREN. *SEREN*. Mmm, delectable. Hello, Seren, I am the Brass King. So far away and yet so far close you are to me.<br>
***Brass King** Maha mahe laughs(?)<br>
**Seren**: Uh, w-where are you?<br>
**Brass King**: A little place so far... a planet... in a waste/aways(?). I can taste the earth, it fades away. But enough about where I am from, I am so more interested in where it is you are from.<br>
**Seren**: Why are you so interested?<br>
**Brass King**: Because, you are like me.<br>
**Seren**: Oh... how did this happen to me? How am I like-<br>
**Brass King**: That's the secret, little girl. We are inside of everything already. That was the secret that the father found.<br>
**Seren**: The... father?<br>
**Brass King**: There's so much you do not know, but do not worry child. Such an occurrence is very rare and I shall not waste it! Now... now, gaze- GAZE INTO MY *BRAIN*!<br>
**Seren**: Oh, oh oh my god.<br>
**Brass King**: T-t-t-tell me, what do you think of me? What do you think?<br>
**Seren**: You're um, very large.<br>

> **Summer**: What exactly does she see in front of her?<br>
**Arcadum**: A robed humanoid figure in bright brass and golden hues.

[<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bGV2DSh.png" alt="Brass King Handout Art" height="250px" />](https://i.imgur.com/bGV2DSh.png)

> **Seren**: Very, elegant?<br>
**Brass King**: Oh, you flatter me~. Our time is short, your comrades will grow impatient. It is unfortunate that our conversation will have to be cut short, but there is something you should know, little goat girl.<br>
**Seren**: Uh- uh huh?<br>
**Brass King**: You see, there are beings that know of The Enemy. I wonder, will your mind of balance turn away the assistance of dark forces, hmm? For we will all be needed against what is to come.<br>
**Seren**: I think that depends on what your goal is after all.<br>
**Brass King**: No need to be picky. After all, without us there will be no after.<br>
**Seren**: Then I guess there is no choice.<br>
**Brass King**: Good. Flex your little muscle, girl. It will need to be strong. Consider this your first lesson.<br>
***Brass King** lets out a loud screech!

Seren eventually awakens, the party questions her, she does her best to explain in a short amount of time. They eventually decide to give the summoning crystal another try noticing that it is once again lit up and functional. The portal opens, uninhibited, and they return to camp.

### The Brass King's Gift

Having just arrived through the portal Seren moves down to the southeast past the Vizier:

> **Arcadum**: Seren, the gift from the Brass King activates.

Arcadum zooms in on the Vizier's forehead:

> **Arcadum**: Your power activates. You use Invasion. Your mind pushes through the mind of Vizier Lozenkor who doesn't even notice the strength and subtlety of your invasion. You learn the following facts: Vizier Lozenkor is depressed, fearful. You can see the memories of being a worm that walks and how his constant struggle with understanding his sense of self puts him at a constant unease. You can feel admiration for Lord Azolon and his acceptance for what he is, you also feel a deep drive and need to prove oneself. Lozenkor will start to bleed from his nose and fall to the ground as you begin to feast on his mind.

The party notices this and Seren tries to stop herself:

> **Arcadum**: Unfortunately, the feast it feels *so good*.<br>
***Neve** attempts to pull her away<br>
**Arcadum**: You place your hands on her and are push backwards your mind reverbiates against a br- almost like a ringing bell. The Vizier will start to take som eheavy damage to his mind his worms begin to spill out of his visage of being human.<br>
***Neve** runs to find Erin.<br>
***Morc** drags Lozenkor away.<br>
**Arcadum**: Eventually as Lozenkor is pulled away he is able to recover himself and Seren's trance is released. Antonious, you notice that her pupils, once the goat eyes, are now wriggling tentacles before they return back to their normal shape.<br>
**Seren**: Huh? What just happened?<br>
**Antonious**: *Seren*, what was that?

> **Arcadum**: Seren, you gain a +1 to your intelligence score.<br>
**Scott (Antonious)**: Was Seren aware of what was happening?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yes. In all of its horror.

> **Antonious**: Seren what did you just do?<br>
**Seren**: I *do not* know. I- oh my god, I just learned things about him that I did not want to know.<br>
**Antonious**: It's okay, it's- it's not your fault.<br>
***Erin** arrives with Neve.<br>
**Erin**: Bruh?<br>
**Neve**: I don't- I don't know what just happened. Something happened with Seren and it seemed like she was draining the Vizier.<br>
**Seren**: Hi.

(Erin, religion check: `4(1)`)

> **Arcadum**: That is, unfortunately, insufficent. But, Erin, because of your exposure to such forces you certainly sense that the little goat girl is definitely different from the last time you met her. You sense that there is a shadow in her mind. It is *very* large.<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: I'll also True Sight to see if I can see anything.<br>
**Arcadum**: As you activate your True Sight, your own gifts from the Leviathans reflect the two of you staring at each other. Small vessels for very large purposes. You feel yourself standing with Seren on a platform, everything else bleeds away. Behind you the Leviathans of the Deep roar and twist and behind her the Brass King moves its robes. And then (*\*snaps\**) you return. You sense that she is possesed by something, something powerful, much like you did when-<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: Do the Leviathans feel opposed to them or just similar?<br>
**Arcadum**: It is as if two predators rule the same mountain for the fear of lack of prey. However, you do sense that there is a *thin* camaraderie between the two of them, for predators will band together to face a larger one. And The Herald is always beckoning.<br>

> **Erin**: (to Seren) We might need to sit down and have a conversation about your new friends.<br>
**Seren**: Yea, I think that'd be a good idea.

### Erin & Seren Have A Chat

The two of them find an unoccupied tent to discuss further and in private:

> **Seren**: Well, this is some shit.<br>
**Erin**: Yea, how're you feeling about the shit you've seen?<br>
**Seren**: Oh, our wing of the labyrinth sucks, like real bad.<br>
**Erin**: No, like specifically what's in your head, not the labyrinth. That's less important.<br>
**Seren**: Yea, but still, I think this happened because of the labyrinth or something in it because I didn't have this in my head before we went in.<br>
**Erin**: True, but I mean, are you- I can't judge- are you the kind of person down for dark powers no matter the cost? What are we dealing with here?<br>
**Seren**: Had a vision about stuff happening in other wings, maybe areas, of the labyrinth. I saw a lot of things and then I was talking with a guy in a big golden robe.<br>
**Erin**: You probably saw where others like you are.<br>
**Seren**: Oh.<br>
**Erin**: Because they're all connected. So, on the one hand maybe you won't have to fight so many things and that'll probably seem pretty cool, but I have some experience with going crazy and it's not really all it's cracked up to be.<br>
**Seren**: Yea, I don't really want to go crazy, but you know, he offered help and in the light of The Herald, we kinda need that.<br>
**Erin**: It's gonna seem like a good idea to accept it's power. And, honestly, it's right that we could use all the help that we get, but it's- if you let it help too much we're gonna save a dead world. You know what I mean?<br>
**Seren**: Mmhmm.<br>
**Erin**: So, I'm sure there's a tin foil hat or something you can put on somewhere in that dungeon. I'd look around for that 'cause Tyre's definitely wearing one.<br>
**Seren**: That's good to know. Thanks, Erin.<br>
**Erin**: Alright, anything else? Concerns?<br>
**Seren**: Yea, I should probaby tell you this, 'cause I think we were gonna talk to you about this, but we're already alone, so uh- So in our wing we found out a few things. I think these're safe to share with you, but you gotta swear to me you're not telling anyone about the second part. I'll tell you when that hits.<br>
**Erin**: I probably couldn't know *more* dangerous stuff, so hit me with it.<br>
**Seren**: We figured out where Tyre's parts are. His Soul, his Heart, his Shadow, we know where they're located.<br>
**Erin**: Okay.<br>
**Seren**: His Soul is on Ad-<br>
**Erin**: Don't- don't say that one. I know that one.<br>
**Seren**: Okay, not that one. Oh, you know about that one? Okay, his Shadow is somewhere here on Verum and his Heart is on Azengolt.<br>
E deflated sigh<br>
**Seren**: Oh, yea, there's also Depthar in our wing.<br>
**Erin**: Yea- no- why do you know that? Why- what?<br>
**Seren**: Umm...<br>
**Erin**: What I'm saying is, are you completely sure?<br>
**Seren**: There are Depthar in our wing. We saw a true Depthar and he was mumbling Druidic. So, you can tell that I kinda might've listened to that.<br>
**Erin**: Yea, no, I'm piecing it together. Definitely find Tyre's tinfoil hat. That's a must, because you're probably gonna have to keep fighting them to get your body part. And as minimal exposure as you can possibly have to the Depthar at all costs.<br>
**Seren**: Yea... but that was the main ones we wanted to tell you about and I just don't think it's a good idea to be telling everyone in the camp that there's a Depthar in wing, because if that gets out, you know-<br>
**Erin**: Oh if you're gonna talk to anybody, Braktor has fought the Depthar before, but I don't think he's gonna be able to tell you any information other than, "They suck." That's all he generally says. I don't think this is a very granular topic. Just avoid them, don't trust them, find the tinfoil hat.<br>
**Seren**: Yea, I'll make sure to look for it.<br>
**Erin**: We all good?<br>
**Seren**: Is there anything else I should know? Is there an alien growing in my brain? 'Cause I'm kinda concerned.<br>
**Erin**: Well, you may have just infecected... that other guy and you should really...<br>
**Seren**: Try to not do that?<br>
**Erin**: Yea, that's- we keep coming back to this tinfoil hat. I personally don't know how to fight the Depthar. I don't know a lot about that.

Arcadum zooms in on Erin's token whilst making a heartbeat sound. Seren, it seems, is trying to Invade again.

> **Ster (Erin)**: Get me a tinfoil hat!<br>
**Summer (Seren)**: Is there a save I can make to fight this?!<br>
**Arcadum**: I'm sorry, Seren cannot be contacted right now. Make me a wisdom saving throw Erin as your training as the Herald of the Deep keeps you safe from this.

(Erin wisdom save: `23(15)`)

> **Arcadum**: Alright, that's my boy. You feel the Invasion attempted against you. Not by some malicious forethought, but by purely by some animal striking out in the corner. Seren's mind is wild and untamed, much like the creatures of which she protects as a druid. She is starving and hungry. Her body quivers, so small and fragile, under the monster that she is soon to become. The Leviathans whisper in your own mind, "Such a beast needs a firm hand."<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: Is there anything I can roll to see what I should do?<br>
**Arcadum**: Arcana.

(Erin arcana: `7(7)`)

> **Arcadum**: Subtlety is out the window it seems. You summon the Leviathans, you're going to have to knock her out. Your eyes widen, your pupils dilate to thin lines within your black irises, your own tentacles begin to squirm as the Deep cries out towards the Depthar. The two presences in both your minds lock arms and attempt to take the other out. Seren's eyes spiral as full tendrils, inky black, move across her eyes and past out of her lids and into the rest of her face. Your own eyes focus, the tentacles of your head spread outward, black ink begins to drip from their edges. The tent begins to rattle, the earth begins to split. However, as the two of you crash into one another there is a break, there is a clarity. It's finally time.
>
> Much like two stone against one another creates a spark, so two do two minds of psyonic disposition rubbing together create a spark. Both of you have your power deactivated, stunned, nearly leveled to unconsciousness. But, in the center between the two of you lies a shard. A shard of concentrated knolwedge, memory, and power. It glows with the Violet light.
>
> **Seren**: What the fuck is that?!<br>
**Arcadum**: As you ask the question the shard cracks. (*\*snaps\**) It opens, like a hatched egg. The Heart of Tyre is revealed to you. Across the expanse of the nebulae, far to the world of Azengolt where the shadow of the Brass King can be seen, you instead see a different vision.
>
> A vision of travellers on a strange moving cart. Their faces are sunken, their visages dour, they're Kalkateshian. Their grim faces harden as the cart comes to a stop. They stand before a deserted wasteland where a tower lies leaning. One of them steps forward, flames billowing out of a tube across his back. Another, a long cylindrical weapon across her back. And in the middle a grey-skinned woman with her face covered gazes through a gap in her hat.
>
> And there on the leaning tower is a pustule growth with the symbol of Tyre. And then (*\*snaps\**) the vision is done.<br>
***Erin** will snatch up the crystal and cover it up and do a quick check of what it even is:

(Erin w/ enhancibility + aid from Seren: `17(9) + 4 ==> 21`)

> **Arcadum**: You have found a shard of Divinity left over by the Seven, and a new secret revealed, and one step closer to the truth.<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: Is that all?<br>
**Arcadum**: That's it. For now.<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: Is that related to the Faith Leyline?<br>
**Arcadum**: Yes.<br>
**Ster (Erin)**: And I don't know in what way?<br>
**Arcadum**: You could probably hazard some guesses, but you don't know for certain.

> **Seren**: What do we do with that?!<br>
**Erin**: I don't know.<br>
**Seren**: That just came out of our brains?! What?!<br>
**Erin**: I need to think about this.<br>
**Summer**: Well, get back to me on whatever you figure out with it, cause whatever it is, it came out of our heads.

> **Ster (Erin)**: Did that change the presence of the Depthar in her mind at all?<br>
**Arcadum**: No, except now both of your presences look at each other with renewed respect and understanding. You feel that for now this Brass King is an ally and you feel that the Leviathans wish for you to be an ally... for now.

### Antonius' Revelation

After heading back to their tent, Seren informs her party the "short version" of what she and Erin discussed. After, they decided to head into camp again and meet up with Trial parties. They make their way over to the pirates (Shadow) and eventually Seren thinks to mention the register they found in their wing. Neve walks over to show it to Ahst, Strippin asks if there is any person or name Ahst may recognize in the register found at the front desk:

> **Arcadum**: The name that you recognize is Derok Dranf.

> **Ahst**: Hang on, that one. Derok Dranf. I know that name.

> **Arcadum**: And you recognize it because- Well, I wanna see- Hold on, actually let me go- Oh, shit, hold on I need to think real quick. Your characters would know that but I don't think you guys did because that didn't happen until after Eustace went to the Covenant. Oh god...
>
> Ahst, you recognize this from one of the visions that Xetor provided to you guys. Specifically, when you were shown the presence of the Seven and Xetor revealed to you, with his amber eye unleashed, there were six bindings that needed to be undone. Six paths that needed to be walked, before the Seven came into their own and Derok Dranf belonged to the second.

Ahst shares that story with the group and decides to transform into Derok Dranf to see if any of the other members of the camp recognize him:

> **Arcadum**: (*\*almost maniacal laughing\**) YES! YES! FINALLY!<br>
You. Turn. Into. Antonious!
>
> Jund. I need to go check my deep notes, you guys talk amongst yourselves.

Arcadum returns and reveals that when Antonius sees this:

> **Arcadum**: As you see yourself through the visions of the Changeling because what Ahst changes into is not Antonius, but who you actually are. And when you see yourself reflected on the mirror that is the Changeling's body a refraction of reality occurs!
>
> Yes! Yes! Changelings are mirrors! Ha ha ha! I finally got to say it!
>
> Listen up, your memories come flowing back into you *Derok Dranf*. As they do this is what you remember. You remember a sister. A terrible crime performed by would be paladins of Glory. Her death, your sorrow, Crowley's call. You remember the complex where they went to perform their debauchery. You walked through the cavernous caves deep below the Krazaxian mine. You slaughtered them all. All of them. And at the end of your bloodsoaked reverie Crowley granted you a true form. You strapped yourself onto the pillar. Blackened horns grew from your head and a flesh mask over your face. And your change to a demon complete.
>
> Before you were banished by the Seven to Abaddon, where you were adopted by the family of those that were waiting and took your place as a rightful prince, chosen by Crowley, before lost into the planar rifts. It all comes flowing back. You met them. You've seen them. You know them. Congratulations, Jund. Antonius, Rivitah, Derok Dranf can now take his place as one of the Cardinals.

Scott asks some follow up questions later on about the transformations his character has undergone and more specifically when he sought revenge for his sister and transformed into his demon/Antonious form:

> **Scott (Derok)**: And do I know how long ago this was?<br>
**Arcadum**: For you? In your time, several hundred years. But to Ahst's knowledge if what you are is to be true, thousands.

### Changelings & Tomen

Immediately following the revelation of who Antonious really is:

> **Arcadum**: Ahst and Neve. Within each of your eyes the realization dawns upon you of the Enemy's use of mirrors and what a Changeling truly is.<br>
Changelings are not but living mirrors. They are attempts by the Hagmothers to replicate the power of the stolen god. Of The Bound One. Of The Walker in Broken Glass. Tomen the Traveler.<br>
You have unlocked him officially as a new deity in Verum.

Tomen will specifically be of the [Blue Pantheon](../../../Lore/Deities%20%26%20Pantheons/Blue%20Pantheon.md#Tomen).

Ahst and Neve head off alone to contemplate this and begin to concentrate and look into each other:

> **Arcadum**: Ahst and Neve, as you begin to infinitely reflect off of each other, unfortunately you lack the appropriate angles. For now you understand by your reflection of each other what the Hags are constantly trying to do. For every Hag tries to perform a coven and that coven comes in a set of three and those covens when combined in sets of three create a trigram, which replicates the power of the Trigram Isles and the secret of humanity's origin which the Hag seek to master.
>
> And as the two of you reflect off one another's faces you realize you're missing a third angle and therefore the ritual cannot be complete. But then you see a visage of a Changeling whom you might be able to find. You see this (he reveals Terryn's token). You see the presence of a white serpent flash through your minds. The serpent has two heads and it forms as a scarf amongst a red-haired man. For the patron deity of Changelings to be restored and for you to be free of your mother's curses you must perform this ritual. You must seek out this third Changeling and then you may yet be free.

### Ives' Redemption

After checking in with Antonious/Derok following his big revelation he and Ives settle things for the moment. Derok heads back to camp and Ives is alone in the woods just outside of camp:

> **Arcadum**: Ives, the trees are in bloom. It looks peaceful here. An uncommon scene in a world filled with uncertainty and conflict. The wind blows through the leaves and a small trail lifts up before you. *Do you follow it?*<br>
***Ives** will walk forward.<br>
**Arcadum**: Ives, as you follow the path the leaves continue to blow, the wind continues to beckon. You travel for some time, time slipping by without you truly noticing how long until you find yourself standing in a small clearing. You reflect on those that you have murdered, those that you have slain. You see their faces again, you see the blood stains upon the leaves around you, as it seems that Autumn is approaching Kalkatesh, there is no peace without forgiveness. When you look up, you find a small shrine. A shrine that you had not noticed hidden away within the leaves and within the trees. Atop it is a stone and stately raven, a crow. And below that the symbol of the Helping Hand, of the Martyr, a shrine to Vavren.<br>
***Ives** tentativey approaches the shrine.<br>
**Arcadum**: As you stand in front of the shrine suddenly the land grows quiet. A soft silence falls over the meadow. The trees move not with wind, the grass is still, and for a moment you feel as if perhaps you don't even exist. Maybe it would be beter for that; the things that you've done, the people that you've killed. Their faces flash, bit by bit. Is what you're doing going to be enough to wipe your ledger clean? In the end will you find salvation? You feel a hand on your shoulder soft, warm, and firm. Do you turn to look?<br>
***Ives** he'll look at the hand but not turn around.<br>
**Ives**: Are you here to kill me?<br>
**Arcadum**: You will turn and you will see a soft, gnarled hand with scars and blackened veins, the tips of its fingers covered in soot. The person does not respond to your question, but merely loosens the grip on your shoulder, softens its stance. Pressing into you, you feel an overwhelming sense of forgiveness, of compassion, of understanding.<br>
***Ives** will now turn fully.<br>
**Arcadum**: As you turn, you see something that you did not expect. You see a rather meek looking creature and yet, you feel that it is quite the opposite.
>
> (Arcadum reveals the token for [Vavren](../../../Lore/Deities%20%26%20Pantheons/White%20Pantheon.md#vavren))
>
> The creature does not speak as you turn. It holds its hands against its chest almost as if its unsure to have you look upon it. Its face is that of a contorted crow. Its visage is somewhat hideous to look upon. It will then "say" but moreso mime a greeting.<br>
***Ives** will nod in response.<br>
**Ives**: Thank you.<br>
**Arcadum**: The creature nods softly and then shakes its head. It will place its hand upon Ives' shoulder. It will then gesture around it. The red autumn leaves begin to swirl around Ives, they're wet and slick. Vavren will reach out and grab one and will hold it to his chest. When he releases it, it is no longer red, but green and it fades with the wind. Vavren will look at you, Ives, and gesture for you to do the same.<br>
***Ives** will reach up with a shakey hand, slowly and pluck a leaf.<br>
**Arcadum**: As you do so, what do you do?<br>
***Ives** will pull it towards himself and stare at it.<br>
**Arcadum**: As you look a long time, you will realize the point of this gesture. Long have you waited for the forgiveness of another, but what you must first do is forgive yourself. Do you do so?<br>
***Ives** thoughts will drift to his sister, standing on a shrine somewhere miles away and he'll smile, look up at Vavren, and let go of the leaf.<br>
**Arcadum**: The leaves will shift all around you. What was once red and bleak is green and filled with life. The green swirling colors will surround you. Dandelion leaves and pollen will join and a calvalcade of colors will swirll before your eyes. And when it fades, Vavren is no longer there. The leaves are green and your heart is at peace.
>
> There is an arrow planted in the ground where Vavren once was, it has upon it the symbol of the crow.<br>
***Ives** will kneel and lift it with both hands.<br>
**Arcadum**: Within it you feel the presence of Vavren. For the Martyr believes in the act of forgiveness but knows the heavy burden is not just towards yourself but on the behalf of all. And the Silent One will see that his aid is provided.
>
> You have been granted the use of The Crow Storm.
>
> (Specifically, you fire the arrow into the air and you rain down a volley of arrows down upon all enemies within 30 feet)
> 
> The way ahead is open and the camp awaits.<br>
***Ives** he'll look up to the trees with arrow in hand and softly say:<br>
**Ives**: Thank you.<br>
***Ives** places the arrow in his top hat quiver and walks forward.<br>
**Arcadum**: As you walk forward the wind at your back, the path of the trees close until the shrine is needed again. You re-enter the encampment once again brimming with purpose.
