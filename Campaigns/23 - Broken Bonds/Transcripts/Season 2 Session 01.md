> **Arcadum**: Shimmer, almost like a reflection of glass. Like heat haze, like a mirage. To Nox, you can see this is a dweller of the dream realm moving to the physical realm. Remag, you see the shifting of this reality through your burning violet light.

> **25(19) Arcana** from Remag:<br>
You are standing directly above a leyline, the natural veins of magic that go throughout Kalkatesh. You know the leylines are weakened, this one seems strong. But like with any problem, you have to find where it is. You believe that if you follow this pulsing leyline you may find the problem, for it seems to be eeking out unevenly, almost bleeding.

Inn is the focal point of the misaligned leyline



Dead person at the inn is named Magden. The ghost is saying "fire, fire, fire". 


> *Hashbrown walks into the flames:<br>
As you step through the flames you come out on the other side, and you see this. The entire place is on fire, you hear screams, screams of the injured and the scared. You hear the call of dangerous and bloodthirsty men, calling for death all around you. You have entered what appears to be a memory.

As you turn you see that the was you had come in was missing.
The edges of the memory are frayed and contorted, and veer off into nothingness. As you turn your gaze to the east you can see in the distance there are more fires swirling with smoke.

Hashbrown calls for Magden, he received no response. He heads to the inn.

The inn is filled with corpses, stains of blood can be seen all throughout the ground, handprints pull along the walls. Devastation.

Flames cover the ceiling, it almost looks as if the main support beams are going to cave in soon.

As you turn to go outside you feel as if you are being watched. Hashbrown heads upstairs.

What you see is an ethereal being floating above the balcony overlooking the end. The edges of it sort of fade out.

 >**???**: Are you alone?<br>
**Hashbrown**: My friend they were in the barn, why do you ask?<br>
**???**: One often seeks companionship when one is alone. So, are you alone?<br>
**Hashbrown**: No I got some people waiting for me, I'd like to go back to them.<br>
**???**: You wish to return?<br>
**Hashbrown**: You can do that right?<br>
**???**: Do you know where you are?<br>
**Hashbrown**: No, is it important? A memory?<br>
**???**: Very good. You are in a memory, but do you know whos?<br>
**Hashbrown**: Probably that ghost.<br>
**???**: A spirit, an apparition, plagues you in the waking world, does it?<br>
**Hashbrown**: He didn't seem that angry, he was okay. So you know how to get out of a memory right?<br>
**???**: I am trapped here just as you are. But for different reasons. I am trapped here because someone has trapped me. You are here because you have walked here. All you must do is wake up, my friend.<br>
**???**: Listen well, for you are in a space between life and death. The brief glimpse of the purgatory that awaits those that are misjudged. I wish for your aid.<br>
**Hashbrown**: How can I help you?<br>
**???**: You wish to return to the waking realm, I can help you do that. I cannot move, I can only do what it tells me. <br>
**Hashbrown**: I'd like to go back with everyone else.<br>
**???**: Very well, then you must wake up. And when you do, please, please find it. <br>
**Hashbrown**: You got it, I'll find it.<br>


> **Zorro**: It is a prison, lady Fe'ar. A prison for souls.<br>
**Fe'ar**: But it's a memory?<br>
**Zorro**: It is a memory for it is a memory of when the soul was taken.


Party minus P'mis and Remag cross over.


>**???**: More have been bound within the memory, the prison. Soon it will be used again. I cannot feel it, it pulls me. It makes me do what I wish not.<br>
*Nox will attempt to grab its arm.<br>
**Arcadum**: As you grab its arm you get a flash of insight. You see the inn, you see the twisted mangled hand of some kind of clawed creature. You see a symbol, a symbol of a seven pointed star, shattered at different points. And then, you see a large rotund Tabaxi standing in a room, twisting a small device back and forth, as the spirit before you dances. 

>**???**: Not again, not again. I know of Big Dao, yes.<br>
**Li'lu**: Is he making you do this?<br>
**???**: I had no choice.

The spirit will start to weep, ethereal flame will burn all around it. It seems there is more to the story, more to the memory.

> Fe'ar touches him.<br>
**Arcadum**: You will see that he standing next to Big D, looking at this very inn, and it's bustling and happy. Everything seems to be going well. The owner of the inn comes out and waves, and you see it is another Tabaxi. This one appears to have white fur, a simple helmet with goggles on it. And then, you see something else. Figures standing just out of sight, they bare symbols of a shattered star, seven points. You can see, as the spirit, something is hunting you. Something is waiting for you on the other side. 

>Li'lu touches him.<br>
**Arcadum**: The final insight is revealed. You see that Big D points his fingers forward, and this man, and several others, charge the inn, set it aflame, slaughter the people. When the sun begins to set, the corpses are buried, and Big D now owns an inn.

Nox, you sense something else. In your flash of insight the device that was used, it was druidic in design. 

>**Party**: Do you have a name?<br>
**Carson**: My name was once Carson.<br>
**Carson**: The star, the star he holds gives him power over me.<br>
**Carson**: He has used me several times.

Big D has a necklace with the symbol of the shattered star on it.
Big D Martial: He was, but success has fattened him up. He is a non-combatant.

Party restrains and knocks Big D out, then steals the shattered star emblem.


As you search him you will find that there is curious device, you will see that there is a small cross shaped object, it's covered in gears and cogwheels, in the center there are levers with several dials. It is radiating magic.

>**15 Arcana**:<br>
That device is a soul tether. It is no doubt that is being used to control the spirit. You will also find that there is a note of correspondence. 

Note: Our movements in Orde remain somewhat undetected, there are a few entities we sense being sent to deal with us. Continue your operation, it is of the utmost importance.

There is a diagram that shows different attack points of the inn, different vulnerabilities in the patrols. 


>**Big D**: I guess the veil is lifted, you're sharper than you appear.<br>
**Nox**: If you speak any louder than I do, your eyes will go first, then your life.<br>
**Big D:** Your threats are idle to me, Dragonborn.<br>
**Nox**: Are we going to speak truths or continue this game?<br>
**Big D**: Depends, what are you trying to gain?<br>
**Big D:** You speak of the soul tether, what about it?<br>
**Nox**: It's just yours to keep?<br>
**Big D**: Yes.<br>
**Big D**: The easiest way to capture a fly is with honey.<br>
**Li'lu**: You killed all those people.<br>
**Big D**: I did.<br>

>**Nox**: What's happening in Orde?<br>
**Big D**: You don't know?<br>
**Nox**: I've been away, enlighten me.<br>
**Big D**: Revolution. Change comes slowly in the bureaucracy of the holy city, but change still comes.<br>
**Nox**: Political standpoint, or more than that?

>**Big D**: For all this time you've spent interrogating or humiliating me, you haven't been watching my hands.<br>
*The spell he has been casting completes itself.<br>
**Big D**: See you soon.<br>
*Big D will vanish.<br>
**Arcadum**: Big D is gone. But, you have the soul tether. 

>**Arcadum**: As you study the soul tether, it is made through nature magic, specifically. It takes you a little bit of experimenting, but you understand how it works, and you also know how to turn it off.

Fe'ar will turn it off.

>**Arcadum**: Remag, you feel a shift in the leylines, and they begin to smooth. The soul tether that had been active, constantly commanding the other spirits, causing a ripple in the life energy around it has now ceased. With the lifestream corrected the leyline is now realigned. 


Nox leaves the group to return to other duties, and the session will end.
