## The Prism Staff

Wielded by a Living World player character, Amaris. A treasure she knows very little about and has it permanently soul-bound to herself. It is said attempting to unattune from it will mean certain death.

The stats of the staff are given below, courtesy of Amaris' player:

> You may activate one of the following effects an an action, only once per long rest.
>
> **Red** – You fire a line of fire damage 120ft long. This line deals [10d6] fire damage. After dealing this damage, the staff grants a +2 to attack rolls to the wielder.
>
> **Orange** – You summon a rain of acid damage within 60ft and in a 30ft radius. This effect deals [10d6] acid damage. After dealing this damage, the staff grants a +2 to armor class.
>
> **Yellow** – You summon a bolt of lightning down upon a single enemy. This deals [10d6] lightning damage. This also knocks the enemy prone, if airborne it causes the creature to fall 200ft immediately. After dealing this damage, the staff grants a 20ft increased movement speed.
>
> **Green** – You summon a storm of poison, that attaches itself to three enemies you can see within 60ft. This deals [10d6] poison damage. After this damage is dealt, the staff grants a +2 to skill checks
>
> **Blue** – You summon a glacial prison, you may select an enemy within 20ft. That enemy takes [10d6] cold damage. It also has it’s speed reduced to 0 for 1 round. After dealing this damage, the staff grants a +2 to saving throws.
>
> **Indigo** – You summon the mortal light of The Seven. Doing so grants all allies within 30ft, 30 hit points. If an ally died within 3 rounds of the use of this ability that ally may live again if healed in this manner. You may only use this ability if at least 3 other colors have been used.
>
> **Violet** – All things have their price. For within the prism lies the strength of the enemy, ever tempting, ever waiting. For each other color you have implemented since the last long rest, there is a 10% chance at the start of your turn, you MUST use this color. When you use this ability all creatures within 1 mile, are stunned for 1 minute unless they are a servant of the enemy. This ability increases the entropy in the world by 1 when it is used.
>
> All +2 passive effects last until you perform your next long rest.
