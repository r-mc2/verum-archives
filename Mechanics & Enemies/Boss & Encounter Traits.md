`(???)` - We lack confirmation.<br>
`(?)` - Specific source uncertain, but it has been referred to before.<br>
`()` - Requirements or Stating that it is a greater form of a previous ability.<br>
`[]` - Personal suppositions from the community of what Arcadum’s wordings on abilities might mean, and/or some light memeing.

e.g. Tier 2 has 2 Initiatives, Tier 3 has 3, etc.

### Violet Traits

Traits unique to creatures who fight for The Enemy.

* **Speaker** - This enemy can speak Power Words of “The Enemy”.

### Clash-Based Traits

Clashes are a special "cinematic" 1v1 attack between two creatures, usually an enemy and a player character. Think of those scenes with two samurai who run past each other and in an instant one is injured/downed. The clash is that instant of attack. It is represented by opposed dice rolls by each creature.

The below traits can specify which type of clash a creature is capeable of or augment those clash types:

* **Martial Adept** - This enemy is a Martial Weapon Specialist and can engage/be engaged in martial clashes.
* **Martial Master** - (*Tier 2 Martial Adept*) Martial clashes can occur. Martial Master means that this enemy has advantage on all clashes of this nature. In addition, they may clash at will.
* **Shared** - (*Modifier for Martial Adept*) Attempting to clash against one enemy will cause all other enemies to participate, regardless of distance. [This modifier could be possible with other forms of Adept]
* **Magical Adept** - This enemy specializes in Magical combat and can be engaged in magical clashes.
* **Magical Master** - (*Tier 2 Magical Adept*) This enemy always has advantage on Magical Clashes. 
* **Bardic Adept** - This enemy specializes in Bardic combat and can be engaged in bardic clashes. [Epic Rap Battles of Verum]
* **Draconic Adept** - This enemy has access to dragon abilities. It will cause clashes when mixed with other dragon abilities.

### Death Related Traits

These traits will determine the creature's attitude towards a downed enemy.

* **Humiliate** - (*Tier 2 Ruthless*) This enemy will seek to maim, or destroy items after downing player characters.
* **Hopeless** - (*Tier 3 Ruthless*) This enemy will seek to set up situations to kill player characters, even as to go to great detriment to itself to kill a PC, and the deciding roll of their fate is not allowed to be modified in any way besides the base roll. (No Lucky/Inspiration/Etc.)
* **Selective** -  (*Modifier for Ruthless*) They have specific targets they will attempt to kill once downed, they are selective in who they choose to finish off.
* **Merciful** - This enemy will NOT target players after they are downed or after defeating the players they will not be killed, attempting to spare targets instead of kill them.

### Creature's Intelligence Traits

These modify how intelligently the DM, Arcadum, will allow the creature to be in their actions. Predictive/pre-emptive actions, awareness of player actions, etc.

* **Improved Cunning** - This enemy can use meta knowledge and is able to use the DM’s Information and Intelligence.

Not exactly intelligence traits, but given the current creature's intelligence the following traits can be more effectively employed:

* **Improved Combo** - The abilities can be purposefully combo’d, the enemy can set up their ability to combo with other abilities, not tied to randomness. 
* **Greater Combo** - Allows up to 3 layers of synergistic abilities. In explaining that, this trait allows for abilities to be set up in a way that they combo with one another more easily.
* **Momentum** - (*Requires Martial Adept + Combo*) - This enemy has access to Improved Combo, and has the ability to permanently “Change the fights pacing” through his combo abilities.  It can change phases/stances through comboing abilities. [Does not need to manually do it (?)]
